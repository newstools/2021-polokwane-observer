They are travelling through Botswana to the border crossing at Kasane. From there, they travel to Livingstone (Zambia) before making their way to the northeastern corner of Zambia. The official journey kicks off at the source of the Zambezi River near Ikelenge. The longest east-flowing river in Africa, the Zambezi goes through Zambia, Angola, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and finally empties into the coast of Mozambique. The team will travel through the Liuwa National Park (Zambia), past the Barotse Flood Plains (Zambia), Victoria Falls (Zambia and Zimbabwe), Kariba, Mana Pools (Zimbabwe), Cahora Bassa (Mozambique) and Marromeu (Mozambique). They hope to complete the 12 000km journey in three months. The Voetspore crew includes team leader (producer and director) Johan Badenhorst, Francois Marais (technician), Streicher Badenhorst (action camera operator), Norbert Coetzee (logistics), Stefan Sonnekus (cameraman) and Nina Badenhorst (logistics). The team’s vehicle line-up includes three Toyota Land Cruiser 79 (4×4) pick-ups – two in double-cab configuration and one single-cab. Dubbed “the Master of Africa”, the Land Cruiser nameplate is known for its off-road prowess and ability to tackle almost any terrain in Africa. Toyota South Africa Motors is proud to be the official vehicle partner of Voetspore on their 15th expedition. Source: MotorPress
