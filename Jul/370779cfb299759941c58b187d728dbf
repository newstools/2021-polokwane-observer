There’s no need to limit your wardrobe by avoiding your summer dresses in winter. Simply change the way you style them and you’ll be warm and on trend… Layer over and under The secret to wearing dresses in winter is layering. Strappy summer dresses often work well over slim turtlenecks and long-sleeve T-shirts with round necks. For an edgy effect, try jeans or leggings underneath and complete the look with a denim jacket. Wear tights Tights add texture and subtle interest to your look, while providing warmth. Plain black tights should be a wardrobe staple as they can be worn under most dresses, while patterned tights look best under simple dresses in a solid hue. Cover up You can wear your favourite summer dresses with almost any kind of cover up, including coats, jackets and cardigans. Pair a fitted, mid-length dress with a classic trench coat and a floaty dress with a cropped jacket. Classic cardigans look cute with belted dresses, while long knit cardigans suit outfits that hug the body. Wear a sweater This cool idea works with summer skirts too. Just make sure the look is balanced by contrasting fabrics (thin dress, thick sweater) and varying lengths (opt for a cropped sweater over a maxi dress and a longer draped sweater over a short dress). Accessorise Cold weather accessories such as chunky scarves, beanies, thick tights and boots add instant warmth to winter outfits. Vary your boot styles (lace-ups are in) and try sneakers with dresses when tights aren’t needed for a comfortable, contemporary look. * Pic via desray.co.za
