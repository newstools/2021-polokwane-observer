Toyota has since 2019 fitted fuel cell technology, including fuel cell stacks, hydrogen tanks and other key components, into the hydrogen city buses manufactured by CaetanoBus. Increased sales for CaetanoBus is attributed to its ability to design and build zero-emission products that can compete in the European bus market. “With this co-branding, we reinforce the long-standing partnership with Toyota to the whole zero-emission buses business. This allows us both to demonstrate, on the one hand, technical capability and complementary technology, and on the other hand, a true alignment towards decarbonisation,” said CaetanoBus president, José Ramos.  “The H2.City Gold is the CaetanoBus’ hydrogen-powered electric bus using Toyota’s fuel cell system.” Its range is given as 400km with a refuel time in under nine minutes which, one would assume, also contributes to its popularity. “The co-branding of CaetanoBus zero-emission buses shows the confidence we have in our latest investment and our long-standing partnership with Caetano. It also underlines the importance that Toyota places on developing zero-emission mobility beyond cars, on our path to carbon-neutrality,” commented Matt Harrison, president and CEO of Toyota Motor Europe.
