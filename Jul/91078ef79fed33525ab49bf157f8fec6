JAC Motors has been manufacturing electric vehicles since 2014 and offers products within the 2.5 to 12 tons commercial range.
The new N55 EV was introduced in China in 2019. “We are extremely excited about this groundbreaking event for the JAC Motors brand in South Africa,” says Karl-Heinz Göbel, CEO of JAC Motors South Africa. “The new N55 EV is an emission-free truck suitable for a range of city operations which provides a reliable, economical and safe solution to transport operators.” The first N55 EV in the country will be used by logistics specialists AEVERSA. “Its core business comprises the design, engineering, implementation and infrastructure supply to commercial- and industrial customers to effectively roll out their electric vehicle fleet programmes. The N55 EV will assist us with the planning, prototyping and rolling out of precision infrastructure for the conversion to DC Fast Charging commercial fleets to accelerate imminent large scale service delivery,” says Rick Franz, CEO of AEVERSA.  The N55 EV is powered by a liquid-cooled 96.77kWh capacity LFP battery. The battery can recharge to 80% capacity in only one-and-a-half hours and 100% in two hours. Maximum range is about 200km and the N55s top speed is 90km/h. “We aim to provide customised transport solutions to our customers. Low-emission vehicles using alternative energy sources are a great addition to our local product portfolio. EV trucks are vital to reduce the emission of harmful pollutants and will also contribute to the more effective utilisation of limited natural resources for transportation,” concludes Göbel.
