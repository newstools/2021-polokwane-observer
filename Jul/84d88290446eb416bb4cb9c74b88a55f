When it comes to social apps, TikTok is one of the most popular thanks to its fun, short video-sharing format which encourages people to get creative and express themselves in a light-hearted way. The platform has around 689 million monthly users globally, 6 million of whom are in South Africa! Young people are understandably its core market, which is why it’s important to be aware of the app’s built-in safety features. Fortune Mgwili-Sibanda, TikTok’s Head of Public Policy in Africa, shares these easy safety tips… Act and speak out! If there is something on the platform you don’t like, and which goes against TikTok’s Community Guidelines, report it immediately. You can also block negative users from viewing your account. Control and limit interactions When your account is set to private, you will have to approve another user before they can follow you and see your content. You also choose who can find your account, duet with you, respond to your videos, send you private messages and stitch your videos. Encourage families to get involved. The new Bullying Prevention Guide has been introduced to help families learn how to identify bullying, as well as provide them with tools to respond appropriately.  The platform also has Family Pairing, a function that allows a parent to link their TikTok account to their teen’s, offering features such as Screen Time Management, Restricted Mode, and Direct Message controls (these features are available to individual users as well). In addition to the above, TikTok has a number of resources for families who want to learn more about online safety, including its Youth Portal, Guardian’s Guide and educational safety videos.
