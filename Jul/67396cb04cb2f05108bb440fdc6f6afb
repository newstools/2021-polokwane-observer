Scatters are one of our favourite décor elements because they’re an affordable way to breathe fresh life into tired furniture and take part in seasonal trends. If you want yours to look stylish, follow the tips below: Consider your colour scheme – The cushions you choose need to have at least one colour in them that ties in with the rest of the room – take your cue from the walls, curtains, artwork, carpet, even your couch… If your current décor is plain, go for scatters with pattern to lift the room and add visual appeal. A bland cushion on a bland couch will do nothing for your décor look. Let the style of the room dictate quantity – If your décor is quite traditional, an even number of scatter cushions will look best. Try two matching solid square colours in each corner of the couch, and place two smaller matching patterned cushions in front of them. The symmetry will ensure a smart feel. For a modern or eclectic styled room, an odd number of scatters is best. Place five completely different cushions on a three-seater couch – all grouped together in the middle and extending outwards. Alternatively, arrange them with three on one side, two on the other or follow a 2-2-1 pattern. There are no rules, as long as you stay true to your colour palette. Mix it up  – The most effective arrangements are those that feature variety, so don’t be shy to combine cushions of different shapes and sizes. Rectangular scatters look especially good in the middle of a couch. Texture is another key element. Warm knits, natural soft linens, fluffy faux furs, macrame, and plush velvet cushions are all in right now. Flow with the seasons – Alternating scatters according to the time of year is a great tip if you want to have fun with your décor! Spring and summer call for bright colours, florals and botanicals, while autumn and winter lend themselves towards darker, more sophisticated shades, earthy tones and rich texture. * Source and pic: simplycushions.com.au
