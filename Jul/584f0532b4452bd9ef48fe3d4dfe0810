Vomiting, diarrhoea, flatulence, weight loss and constipation are all signs of upset tummies in pets and can be deeply distressing for animals and their owners alike. A visit to your vet will help to diagnose what the issue may be, but disruptions in healthy gut bacteria are a common cause. Dr Guy Fyvie, verterinary adviser to Hill’s Pet Nutrition, explains that dogs’ and cats’ digestive tracts contain billions of microbes and other microorganisms, including “good” and “bad” bacteria. “Just like us, they need a balanced gut microbiome and when this is out of sync it can lead to a troubled digestive system.” Your vet will advise the best solution, but a daily probiotic often helps (we like Protexin Soluble for pets). The right nutrition will also have a positive impact, says Dr Fyvie, particularly if you use a food that incorporates fibre-rich ingredients and prebiotic fibre to nourish the gut. His recommendation: Hill’s Prescription Diet Gastrointestinal Biome which contains psyllium, prebiotic fibres and antioxidants to support recovery (you can expect to see healthy stools within 24 hours) and a stronger immune system for your cat or dog going forward.
