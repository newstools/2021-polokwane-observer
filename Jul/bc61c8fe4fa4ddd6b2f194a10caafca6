Lexus believes that the sales of electrified models will eventually exceed those of petrol/diesel-only variety. “Since 2005, Lexus electrified vehicles have contributed to a cumulative global reduction in CO2 emissions of approximately 19 million tonnes. This reduction is equivalent to the combined CO2 output of approximately 300 000 passenger cars each year for the past 15 years.” “Globally, 33% of it has sold more electrified vehicles during 2020.  In South Africa, Lexus has already established itself as the leading luxury brand for hybrid electrification and this just further demonstrates TSAM’s commitment to this technology. For almost every Lexus model (other than LX, RC, LS and LC) sold in the country, there is a hybrid variant available. In addition, Lexus has two hybrid-exclusive model ranges – the newly-minted IS and the premium compact UX SUV.” The UX was introduced in 2019 and has been one of the brand’s top sales drivers since its inception in South Africa. The UX name is derived from the design team’s guiding concept and describes the vehicle’s mission: Urban + X-over (crossover) = UX. “The Lexus UX 250h range boasts an impressive 135kW and provides exhilarating driving with high-speed responsiveness and a feeling of smooth, natural acceleration,” says Lexus.  The UX models come well equipped and boast driver and front passenger airbags; driver and front passenger knee airbags; driver and front passenger seat-mounted side impact airbags and front to rear side curtain airbags, Standard Adaptive Cruise Control, Pre-Crash System (PCS), Blind Spot Monitor, Lane Keep Assist with improved Lane Departure Alert with Steering Assist and more. And as expected, this luxury brand comes standard with a 7-year/105 000km Warranty and Full Maintenance Plan, Lexus Connect Service and its vehicle service intervals are set at every 15 000km, alternatively once a year.
