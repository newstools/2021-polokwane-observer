Do you have a sunny corner where you like to warm up, perhaps with a mug of coffee or cup of tea? Why not put it to good use by growing herbs and veggies for the family. Other gardeners may say you are daft to plant in the middle of winter but here is an idea. Plant your greens in containers, that are easy to keep in a small, sheltered space, and to move around to follow the sun. What could be nicer than being able to pick fresh herbs or salad veggies all year round. Container gardening can even be taken one step further with the mobile, self-contained Vegepod system that comes in three different sizes, with planters being at waist-height, which is suitable for anyone who doesn’t like bending or has back problems.  The smallest pod is one-metre by half-a metre, as a balcony or starter option. Starting small is always a good idea, because it is better not to over-commit in terms of time and effort when starting out. And it is surprising how much can be grown in such a tiny space. Try this for size: All this and a little more can be grown in the medium pod (one meter by one meter) for a kitchen courtyard. The largest Vegepod is two-metre long and 1 metre wide, the size of a door. All the plant boxes come with an optional stand or can be fitted with wheels. What makes the Vegepod system suitable for all weather, cold included, it the fitted permeable canopy that creates a micro-climate, while still allowing through sun and air. In winter it is kept down to protect tender plants from cold and in summer to keep out the pests. Each Vegepod is fitted with water tanks that provide water to the roots through a water-wick system with a mist sprayer for really hot days.
