Pasta is always a great dinner option, especially if you’re not really in the mood to cook. This recipe is quick, easy and a real crowd-pleaser. You’ll need: 400g cooked penne (or any pasta of your choice); ½ red onion, finely chopped; 3 cloves garlic (made into a paste); 250g mushroom, roughly chopped; 250ml cream; 100ml white wine; 150g bacon, diced; 50g grated parmesan; a handful of chopped parsley; salt and pepper according to taste. How to: Bring a pan up to high heat and add the chopped bacon. Allow the fat to render and the bacon to brown slightly. Next, add the onions and garlic and sauté until golden. Once golden, add the mushrooms and cook until most of the moisture is out. Deglaze the pan with the white wine and cook until the wine has completely evaporated. Turn the heat down to medium and add the cream. Bring the cream up to a slight rumble and then add the cooked pasta and fold it in. Add the parmesan and chopped parsley and fold in evenly. Plate and enjoy! * Recipe & image Kyle Marshall from Capsicum Culinary Studio.
