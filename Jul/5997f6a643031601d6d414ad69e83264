Serves 6 You’ll need: 1 x 400g can Rhodes Quality Tomato Mexican Style; 15 ml oil; 1 onion, finely chopped; 1 garlic clove, crushed; 500g lean beef mince; salt and freshly cracked black pepper; 400g baby marrows, washed and thinly sliced lengthways; 250g plain cream cheese; 2 eggs; ½ cup grated mozzarella cheese; ½ cup grated cheddar cheese; 1 red pepper, seeded and diced. How to: Preheat the oven to 180°C. Heat the oil in a heavy-bottomed saucepan. Add the onion and fry until softened. Add the garlic and fry for a few minutes more. Add the can of tomatoes, Mexican Style and bring to the boil then reduce the heat and simmer gently for 15 minutes and season to taste. In a casserole dish that has been sprayed with non-stick spray, layer up the mince alternatively with the baby marrow slices, ending with a layer of mince. Whisk together the cream cheese and the eggs until smooth and season to taste. Pour the cream cheese mixture over the top of the mince. Mix the cheeses and sprinkle over the cream cheese then sprinkle over the red pepper. Bake the lasagne for 30-40 minutes or until the top is golden and set.
