Like The South African Gold Coin Exchange (SAGCE) & The Scoin Shop, who’ve just given R67 000 towards the revolutionary ‘big-ball wool’ for 67 Blankets for Mandela Day, under the banner Kindness is the Golden Thread. Each branded ball is 300g of continuous knitting and crocheting fun and comes in a kaleidoscope of vibrant colours. 67 Blankets for Mandela Day will distribute this wool to their ‘KnitWits for Madiba’, and will give the crafters the chance to up production and complete an estimated 300 blankets. Philanthropist and founder of the campaign Carolyn Steyn says “What started seven years ago as a simple challenge for me to make 67 blankets by Mandela Day has snowballed into what many are calling a ‘movement’ – a movement for good and change in this world!”.
