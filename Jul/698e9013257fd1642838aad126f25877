The short answer as to what to do about it is – avoid if at all possible! If this is not possible, Masterdrive offers some advice. Avoidance
“If your travel is essential and require you to go through a high-risk area, rather err on the side of caution and choose another route. If there is no other route that you feel confident travelling on, speak to whoever is expecting you about rescheduling or making another plan. With the exception of a medical or family emergency, no trip is worth sacrificing your safety,” says Eugene Herbert. Use technology. Google Maps has a function that indicates no-go areas that should be avoided. Stay calm
“The first step might be to accept that there is a very real possibility that you may find yourself in a spot of bother. Be prepared. The main objective should be to remove yourself from the danger, but do not take risks on the road or endanger anyone standing in the road. If your car is damaged, worry about it later, rather focus on staying mobile and leaving the area.” Do not engage
“Do not allow your anger or resentment about the situation, rule your decisions. If it is an extremely volatile situation that is likely to be worsened by expressing your anger to the protesters. Remind yourself, your personal safety is the priority and follow your plan to leave the situation with as little engagement as possible.” “Minimise the tips to remember by following these three simple steps so that if you find yourself in a panic and in a difficult situation, you can quickly remember what to do without much effort,” concluded Herbert.
