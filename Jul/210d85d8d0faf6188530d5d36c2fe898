Besides being juicy and delicious, mangoes are packed with loads of the vitamins your child’s body needs. Here are some tasty facts about mangoes from the South African Mango Growers’ Association: Children’s diets that are low in vitamin C are linked to poor wound repair and excessive skin dryness. The good news is that mangos are packed with vitamin C. Golden nugget: When it comes to mangos, the vitamin C content depends on the variety and maturity of the mango. The less ripe the mango, the higher the vitamin C content. Along with its high vitamin C content, mango is high in vitamin A, another must-have to support a healthy immune system. Mangoes are a great source of vitamin E and are high in beta-carotene (which converts into vitamin A in the body). Both of these nutrients act as potent antioxidants – powerful molecules that protect your child’s skin against damaging free radicals. An accumulation of free radicals causes cell and DNA damage. Golden nugget: Riper mangoes also have higher amounts of beta-carotene. One of the most frustrating skin conditions when it comes to your child’s teen years is acne, which is mostly caused by inflammation and infection of the glands of the skin that make oil. It is thought that foods with a high GI (glycaemic index), such as white bread, sugar, and sugary drinks and treats) rapidly increase blood sugar and insulin levels which may lead to the hormonal changes that cause acne. Golden nugget: To help banish blemishes and protect your tween and teen from pesky pimples make mangoes a regular feature in their diet. In addition to having all sorts of vitamins and minerals, mango is low in fat and only has about 100 calories per serving, making this delicious tropical fruit a great low-calorie option when your child feels like a yummy snack. Golden nugget: One cup of mango slices equals one fruit portion for children. Each serving of mango is fat-free, sodium-free, and cholesterol-free.
