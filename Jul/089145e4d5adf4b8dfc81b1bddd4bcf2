“We have to acknowledge that transport is a part of the problem when it comes to climate change. At the same time, we can and we will be part of the solution. We start with our eActros that has covered more than half a million kilometers on public roads,” Karin Rådström, member of the board of management at Daimler Truck AG and responsible for Mercedes-Benz Trucks, said. Rådström is convinced of the concept and market potential of the eActros. “The eActros and its dedicated services are a big step for Mercedes-Benz Trucks and for our customers towards CO2-neutral transport.” The eActros is powered by two integrated electric motors and a two-speed transmission. “Depending on the version, the eActros draws its power from three or four battery packs – each with a capacity of around 105kWh. Thanks to a maximum capacity of 420 kWh2, a range of up to 400 kilometres is realistic. The eActros can be charged with up to 160kWh when connected to a regular 400A DC charging station, the three battery packs need a little longer than one hour to charge from 20% to 80%.”  Active and passive safety systems include MirrorCam, Sideguard Assist S1R and the fifth generation of Active Brake Assist (ABA) with pedestrian detection. “The global debut of this groundbreaking vehicle was certainly an electrifying and sensational moment for us locally. Hats off to our Mercedes-Benz Truck counterparts for this revolutionary vehicle that sets the brand apart. This is certainly a giant step towards an electrically driven future and we are proud to be a part of a brand that is continuously at the forefront of developing cutting-edge solutions for customers. As we wait in great anticipation to officially usher in this truck of the future to the South African market, we look forward to possible customer demonstrations and trial opportunities,” concludes Maretha Gerber, head of Mercedes-Benz Trucks Southern Africa.
