Serves 2 – 3 You’ll need: 2x 73g MAGGI Crispy Chicken Flavour 2 Minute Noodles; 30ml butter; 15ml cake flour; 180ml reserved noodle broth*; 1 can (380g) Nestlé Ideal Medium Fat Evaporated Milk; 15ml Maggi Original Chilli Sauce; 5ml lemon zest and juice; ½ cup frozen peas; 6 crispy cooked bacon rashers, chopped; ½ cup feta cheese, cubed; 15ml fresh parsley or chives, chopped (optional); milled black pepper. How to: Prepare the Maggi Crispy Chicken Flavour 2 Minute Noodles according to the packet instructions. Once ready, reserve 180ml of the cooking liquid and discard the remaining liquid. Keep the prepared noodles covered until ready to use. Melt the butter in a pan, then stir in the cake flour. Cook for a minute and whisk in the reserved noodle broth and Nestlé Ideal Medium Fat Evaporated Milk. Cook for 3-4 minutes or until the sauce has thickened. Stir in the Maggi Original Chilli Sauce, lemon zest and juice. Cook the peas in boiling water for 2 minutes and drain. Add the cooked noodles, peas, bacon and feta cheese to the sauce. Combine gently and heat through. Season with pepper and garnish with fresh herbs, if desired. Tip: Replace the cooked bacon with ham or salami * Recipe & image by Maggi.
