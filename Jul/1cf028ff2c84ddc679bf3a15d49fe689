While you can’t wrap your baby in bubble wrap to keep them safe, there are a few simple things you can do at home to avoid accidents, and the first place to start is the nursery. Following a few tips can help keep your baby healthy, happy, and safe. Here are a few things to keep in mind: Only a fitted sheet should be in your baby’s cot; no pillows, toys, cot bumpers, or duvets should be present. You can keep your baby warm with a baby sleeping bag if it’s a little chilly outside. Avoid placing your child’s crib near a window. Not only are the curtains and cords choking hazards for small babies, but as your child grows older, he may try to leverage himself on the crib to climb out the window. If you’re decorating the nursery for your first child, make sure top-heavy furniture is secured to the wall with a strap or nails to prevent items from falling down onto your baby. If your baby’s room lacks carpets, invest in some rugs with non-skid backing so you don’t slip and fall while carrying your baby.
