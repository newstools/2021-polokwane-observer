Well, it is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. “The Fiat 127 was a truly modern car for its time – roomy on the inside and small on the outside, just like the still highly relevant mobility vision of the designer Pio Manzù, who died prematurely in 1969,” said Fiat.  Suffice it to say that Fiat registered as many as 15 new patents to develop the 850 City Taxi and it made its debut at the Turin Motor Show in 1986. The Taxi was based on the Fiat 850 and fitted with an “Idroconvert” power-assisted transmission featuring a torque convertor to assist and ease city driving.  The rear seats could seat three passengers. It also boasted a small TV screen and radiotelephone which enabled the driver to communicate with his office via a microphone mounted in the sun visor.
