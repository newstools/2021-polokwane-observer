The contest cater for age groups under eight, eight to 11 years and 12 to 15 years. “We are obviously sad that Covid-19 has made it impossible for us to host the winners at Toyota like we’ve done before the pandemic hit, but we’ve had to improvise. The Dream Car competition is aimed at encouraging children to visualise and sketch mobility solutions of the future – and we hope that it was like seeing their artwork coming to life when they saw the cars that delivered their prizes,” said Glenn Crompton, the vice president of marketing at TSAM. The first prize in the u/8 category went to Zuhayr Syed Ebrahim for his “air mobile”, which he said is based on his imagination to “see it race other air mobile cars and to see a great view on cruise mode”.  Ridhima Hingorani’s “leaf car” claimed first spot in the eight-to-11-years category. She said her piece was inspired by her desire to create an eco-friendly vehicle “that works like a leaf… It will take energy from air and sunlight and will use biogas as an alternative fuel source.” In the 12-to-15-years category, Karabelo Musi walked away with first prize for her “Toyota Dream Car” – a vehicle that is about creating “happiness to be spread throughout the world and for negativity to be sucked away”. There were more than 11 000 entries and Toyota also recognised four runners-up in each category. Category winners received a PS5 to the value of R15 000, while the prize for second place was an Xbox valued at R7 000, third place a laptop to the value of R5 000, a tablet valued at R3 000 for fourth place and a R2 000 Makro voucher for fifth place.
