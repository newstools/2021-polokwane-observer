Big on girl-power, and even bigger on real friends, the six-episode final season of The Bold Type is now showing on Showmax. The new season holds the promise of long-overdue break-ups, tantalising hook-ups, fan-favourite make-ups, heart-breaking split-ups, character clean-ups (for those messy loose ends left by the pandemic-enforced abrupt end to Season 4) and level-ups for Jane, Kat, and Sutton as they navigate life, work and love in New York City.   Dogs are known as man’s best friend, so it goes without saying that the animals form tight bonds with their caregivers. This docuseries celebrates those bonds between people and their beloved four-legged buddies. Dogs on Netflix profiles people and their pooches, telling stories from around the world that prove the unconditional love one feels for their dog is a universal truth. The show takes viewers on an inspirational journey that explores the remarkable, perhaps even magical, qualities that have given the animals a special place in most people’s hearts.   A darkly comedic drama detailing the lives of three women living in three different decades: a housewife in the 60s, a socialite in the 80s, and a lawyer in 2019, each dealing with infidelity in their marriages. Why Women Kill is now showing on M-Net.
