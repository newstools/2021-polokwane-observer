One thing is for certain, South Africans are no strangers to protests and riots. While 62 per cent of protests are peaceful, recent protest action in various parts of the country erupted in violence and malicious property damage, with reports of one uninsured car dealership losing 32 vehicles in a fire. ‘Because of the unpredictable and often chaotic nature of these incidents, both private and public property can suffer expensive damage,’ says Ricardo Coetzee, Head of Auto & General Insurance. ‘It is for this reason that we encourage people to ensure that Sasria (The South African Special Risks Insurance Association) cover is included in their insurance policies so that they are covered should the matter affect them personally. If they’re not properly covered, their insurance company might reject claims for damage or loss incurred during a strike, civil unrest or protest.’ ‘At Auto & General, Sasria is automatically included in your car insurance policy, if your vehicle is currently financed, and you tell us this during the underwriting stage of your policy. After the vehicle has been paid off, your Sasria cover will continue as long as your insurance policy does.’ Auto & General shares a few tips to keep you and your loved ones are safe: Click here for more information about the Sasria cover.
