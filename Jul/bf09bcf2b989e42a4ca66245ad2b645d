If your skin is looking winter weary, exfoliation will give it a boost by sloughing off dead skin cells and stimulating circulation and collagen production. Scrubs, loofahs and dry body brushing and are all effective tools, but body scrubs have the added benefit of nourishing and hydrating the skin, depending on the ingredients used. The recipes below are quick and easy to make using pantry essentials such as sugar, salt and coffee. Store any unused scrub mixture in a sterilized (boiled) jar and keep it tightly sealed to avoid bacteria getting in. Remember that DIY scrubs will spoil faster than store-bought varieties which contain preservatives. Apply your scrub in a warm bath or shower and massage it gently over the body in circular motions before rinsing off. Repeat weekly for best results, unless your skin is sensitive, irritated or you have an open wound (in which case, don’t do it at all!). Always moisturize afterwards – and never use body scrubs on your face. ½ cup fresh ground coffee ½ cup coconut oil or almond oil ½ cup fine ground salt or sugar Mix all the ingredients and apply. ½ cup brown sugar ¼ to ½ cup coconut, olive, jojoba or grapeseed oil 3 – 6 drops essential oil (optional; we love grapefruit to invigorate, lavender to calm, peppermint to uplift and frankincense for skin renewal) Combine the brown sugar and oil in a bowl and mix until you get your desired consistency, then add the essential oils and apply. 1 cup finely ground sea salt ¼ cup carrier oil such as coconut, olive, jojoba or grapeseed oil 5 – 6 drops essential oil (try eucalyptus or rosemary and lemon) Mix the salt and oil, then add your essential oils, stir and store in an airtight container until ready to use.
