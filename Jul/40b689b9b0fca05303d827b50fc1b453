Serves 4 You’ll need: 1 Tbsp Canola/ olive oil, divided; ¾ cup chopped onion; 2 garlic cloves, chopped; 5 regular or whole-wheat hamburger buns, toasted and divided; 400g white button mushrooms, sliced; 1x 400g tin lentils, drained; 4 tsp mustard, divided; 2 tsp chopped fresh thyme; ½ tsp freshly ground black pepper; ¼ tsp salt; 2 large eggs, lightly beaten; 30g feta cheese, crumbled; 1 ½ Tbsp canola mayonnaise; ½ cup rocket. How to: Preheat the grill. Heat a large non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat. Add one teaspoon of oil to the pan and swirl to coat. Add onion and garlic, sauté for three minutes or until onion is tender. Remove from heat. Place one bun in a food processor, process until coarse crumbs form. Remove breadcrumbs from the food processor and set aside. Combine mushrooms, lentils, two teaspoons of mustard, thyme, black pepper and salt in a food processor and pulse to combine. Combine onion mixture, breadcrumbs, mushroom mixture, and eggs in a large bowl, stirring well. Divide mixture into four equal portions, gently shaping each into a 1.5cm-thick patty. Heat a large non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the remaining two teaspoons of oil to the pan and swirl to coat. Add patties and cook for four minutes on each side or until browned. Remove patties from the pan and arrange them in a single layer on a baking sheet. Sprinkle patties evenly with cheese. Place under the grill for two minutes or until cheese is softened. Combine canola mayonnaise and the remaining two teaspoons of mustard in a small bowl. Spread the top half of each of the remaining four buns with two teaspoons of the mayonnaise mixture. Top each bottom half of the bun with one patty. Divide rocket evenly among burgers and top with the top half of bun, mayonnaise-coated side down. * Recipe and image by the South-African Mushroom Farmers’ Association.
