If you’re lost for ideas on what to do this weekend with your toddler or preschooler, heading to the kitchen and whipping up delicious but easy-to-make raspberry tartlets together might just be the answer. Capsicum Culinary Studios’ Chef Hayley Sutherland shares her recipe for homemade chocolate tartlets covered in bright red, juicy raspberries. Best of all, your child will enjoy stirring, kneading, and scooping the batter into baking moulds. Encourage them to use their senses — smell the raspberries, touch the flour, and even taste the dark chocolate before it goes into the mixing bowl.
