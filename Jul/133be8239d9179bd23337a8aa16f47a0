Light, slim and stylish with a celestial blue finish, the first thing you notice when opening up the ZenBook is the titling secondary display flowing into the main screen. Okay, so we admit it screams sophistication, but what we fell in love with was how effortless it is to navigate between tasks. Think efficient video conferencing and expanded workspace giving you that next-level edge on the rest. Say goodbye to move, scroll and click, and hello to touch, draw and flick. The ScreenPad Plus software is the big drawcard – designed to give you a fuss-free experience with features like Task Group allowing you to open multiple apps, a window flick to move the apps in between the two screens, and touchpad mode for better control. In addition, you can now create your own fully customisable virtual deck of sliders, buttons and dials for Adobe apps with the Control Panel app. More plus points …  enjoy the luxury of precise creativity; the NanoEdge display provides a 93 per cent screen-to-body ratio; it’s PANTONE validated which means you can view colours and shades as intended with accuracy. It is a perfect fit for developers, creators, and graphic designers who need a whole lot of power and precision but also ideal for people who would prefer to work smart, not hard.
