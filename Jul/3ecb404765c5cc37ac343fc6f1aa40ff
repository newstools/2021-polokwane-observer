The XC60 is a bestseller – here and internationally. According to Greg Maruszewski, the managing director of Volvo Car South Africa, the XC60 has accumulated a substantial number of awards. “While the world car of the year title in 2018 was one of its most prominent achievements, the XC60 has been lauded with global awards over the last decade, in categories ranging from design to safety,” he revealed. In February, for instance, the XC60 was awarded the top safety pick plus. “We are proud that the American Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has awarded a top safety pick plus to every vehicle we produce today. No other company has achieved this honour across its entire vehicle range,” noted Maruszewski. The XC60 has amassed a number of awards in South Africa, too. For instance, the third year in a row, Volvo’s global bestseller trumped its formidable German competition for the premium midsize SUV/crossover crown, when it was awarded CAR’s Top 12 Best Buys accolade for 2021. There is an expression: “If it works, fix it”. The XC60 has proved that it has what the market wants, but even so, Volvo has added some upgrades to it regardless. These include Android-powered infotainment with built-in Google Maps. “After years of close development between the two companies, the fully electric XC40 Recharge – available in South Africa later this year – became the first Volvo car to feature the system. Now it’s also being rolled out to the XC60,” Maruszewski concluded. Source: MotorPress
