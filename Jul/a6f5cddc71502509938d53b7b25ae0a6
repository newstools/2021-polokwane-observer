Serves 4 You’ll need: 1 large or 2 small avocados; 50g assorted cocktail tomatoes; 4 garlic cloves, crushed; 150ml avocado oil or extra-virgin olive oil, divided in half; sea salt and freshly ground black pepper; 1 block (approximately 200g) Greek feta cheese; ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (optional); 300g dried pasta, medium-size shape; fresh basil leaves, for serving. How to: Preheat the oven to 200°C. In a baking dish, combine half the oil, tomatoes, garlic and seasoning and toss to coat. Place the block of feta in the centre of the dish and sprinkle with chilli flakes, if using. Bake in preheated oven for 40 minutes, until the tomatoes burst and the feta is golden brown. While the tomato is cooking, boil the pasta in salted water until al dente, drain and set aside. Peel and dice the avocado. Remove tomatoes and feta from the oven, toss with the pasta and diced avocado and drizzle with the remaining oil. Serve hot in bowls and garnish with fresh basil leaves. * Recipe and image by The South African Avocado Growers’ Association.
