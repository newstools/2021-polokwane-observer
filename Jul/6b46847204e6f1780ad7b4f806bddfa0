We’re planting …Verbena ‘Firehouse’ for vibrant winter and spring colour on the patio and in the garden. It is a spreading verbena, up to 55cm, that works well as a filler in mixed containers and baskets, as well as a groundcover in gardens. Start it in a pot for colour on a warm sunny patio that is protected from frost. As a garden plant it needs frost protection and if planted now will provide spring into summer colour. It tolerates heat, grows in ordinary garden soil that drains well and likes regular, but not excessive watering. Its wide range of colours makes it easy to add into any garden colour scheme. Also resistant to powdery mildew. New colours include ‘Blue Fizz’ and ‘Violet wink. www.ballstraathof.co.za  Indoor plant of the month: Peperomia ‘Watermelon’ is a striking little plant with large, fleshy leaves that look like the rind of a watermelon.

This is a good plant for a beginner, being easy to care for. It just needs enough bright light and no over watering. www.lvgplants.co.za  Veggie of the month: there is nothing sweeter than eating garden peas from the pod. ‘Tom Thumb’ is a dwarf bush pea from RAW seeds that is fun for the kids to plant in containers or small spaces.  Plants grow 30cm high and 10cm wide, which means that you can plant them 10cm apart along a mini trellis. Pods are best when harvested young, within 50 days from germination. The peas are sweet and crunchy. Tips for garden peas www.rawliving.co.za  Garden tasks for July
