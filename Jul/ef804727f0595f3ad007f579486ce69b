Separation anxiety isn’t just for humans. In fact, many animals experience it, but it often gets misdiagnosed because so many symptoms – like chewing – resemble misbehaviour. While no one knows the exact cause, changes in routine, location and ownership are all triggers, as is the loss of a family member. Some breeds, such as Jack Russells, Border Collies, Lab Retrievers and Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (all hugely social dogs) are more prone to it than others, like French bulldogs and Bassett hounds, for example. Typical signs of separation anxiety include: Potential solutions: Whatever happens, don’t punish or scold your dog as this will only heighten his distress. Kindness and compassion are key here, as is patience and persistence.
