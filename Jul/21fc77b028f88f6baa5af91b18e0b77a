The cabin provides seating for a driver and two passengers and offers air conditioning and a radio with MP3 and USB functionality. In its latest iteration, it is fitted with a Euro 3 Cummins ISF 3,8-litre engine that offers 105kW and 450Nm and an Allison 1000 six-speed automatic transmission and a full air dual circuit WABCO braking system with ABS. The SKD kits from FAW China Corporation include the cab, the chassis, axles and other sub-assembly components. Additional parts are sourced internationally and locally. This includes the full-air brakes and the anti-lock braking system, the power steering unit, the air-cut parking brake and the engine. The suspension is of the straight ladder-type with semi-elliptical leaf springs, with front double acting shock absorbers and rear auxiliary springs. Customers can also choose to purchase the chassis cab and fit their own truck bodies to suit their specific requirements. It is sold with a two-year/unlimited kilometre warranty and benefits from the full extent of sales and/or service from representative outlets across South Africa, Namibia and Botswana.
