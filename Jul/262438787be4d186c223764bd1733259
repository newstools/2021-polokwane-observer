If you’re a parent, you know how difficult it can be to get your child off their iPad or PlayStation and onto the exercise mat, so here’s an animal walk workout that you and your child can do together… Did you know that youngsters between the ages of three and five require three hours of active play each day? Toddlers probably get the majority of their activity playing with their friends, but now that we’re all social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it can be difficult to ensure that small bodies get enough exercise. Although there are online workouts, many of the family workouts are better suited to older children with longer attention spans and better coordination. Fortunately, Strong Mom’s personal trainer Denise Chiriboga has created a fun 10-minute animal workout for kids. While this isn’t the same as running and playing with friends outside, it’s a terrific way to burn off energy, have fun as a family, and give everyone a much-needed mood boost when you can’t get outside.
