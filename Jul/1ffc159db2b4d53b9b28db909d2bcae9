This is how to do it at Shell: Once you have filled up with petrol, inform the frontline service champion that you wish to use the mobile payment option.They will then present you with the payment terminal with the QR code on it. Launch your favourite mobile payment application, select the payment card you want to use, and verify your identity for the payment app using your pin or fingerprint. Hover or tap your mobile device over the payment terminal to scan the QR code and make your payment.
