With the closure of gyms under the recent lockdown regulations, Sudor is opening up its platform to fitness fanatics needing their daily exercise fix. More specifically, Sudor is offering gym members who can no longer go to the gym due to the restrictions, access to the Sudor fitness platform for the entire month of July for only R1 – even if gyms reopen sooner. Sudor is a fitness platform that partners with trainers and gyms to help them generate an income while bringing affordable fitness to the masses. Fitness lovers can access workouts from their favourite South African trainers and brands, such as Mapule Ndhlovu, SWEAT 1000, Khanya Modipa, Jenni Rivett, Rudi Witkowski and more, as well as international trainers. To access the Sudor fitness platform for R1, simply email support@sudor.fit with proof of an existing gym membership. Details: Visit sudor.fit or search for Sudor on Google Play or the App Store.
