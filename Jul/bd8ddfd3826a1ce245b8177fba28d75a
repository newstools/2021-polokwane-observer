With the return to adjusted level four regulations, restaurant and liquor business owners are once again faced with severe financial implications. The regulations disallow for the selling of liquor, both for on-site or off-site consumption, while restaurants are only permitted to sell food for takeaway or delivery purposes. Polokwane Observer spoke to local business owners to determine the impact that this is having on them. Lawrence Phuti Mabitsela, the owner of SweetPhops Lifestyle said the lockdown regulations negatively affect his business. “We had to close down completely because of the ban on the sale of liquor and sit-ins. I just stocked up for both SweetPhops Lifestyle and SweetPhops Café which just launched on Saturday, I do not know what I must do with the stock now.” he said. He said he had no choice but to close the business down for the time being, which affects staff too. “The worst thing is that we have no guarantee that we can reopen in 14 days, as there is a possibility of an extension if things do not improve,” he said. Bennet Mashego, the owner of Bottles Up Tavern said the lockdown is detrimental to his business, as selling liquor is his only means of an income. “For a small tavern like this, I do not have the option of selling food for takeaways, so I have been forced to close and let go of the person who was assisting me,” he said. He added that he does not know how he will survive the next two weeks as the tavern is also his main source of income. The manager of Dros Polokwane, Givemore Macheka said since the move to level four, business has been “dismal”. “We are completely grounded, we are not even making 10% of what we usually make and we are not working at full capacity. It is devastating, especially for the workers who have children or other dependents to support,” he said.
