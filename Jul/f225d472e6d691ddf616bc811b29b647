Foodie sensation Zola Nene is known for simplifying complex cooking processes with her easy-to-follow recipes. And her super easy, super quick recipe blueberry cheesecake is by far one of our favourites, simply a must-try … Which, by the way, she makes in an LG NeoChef convention! Gone are the days where microwaves were reserved for heating leftovers or just defrosting frozen foods. The best part of the NeoChef Convection is that it offers consistent, even heat and precise temperature control, whether you want to bake, warm food, make biltong or yoghurt, or use your microwave as an air fryer, steamer, roaster, slow cooker or grill. Zola’s blueberry-ripple baked cheesecake Serves: 8-10 You’ll need: 350g ginger biscuits; 80g butter, melted; 800g cream cheese, at room temperature; 200g sour cream, at room temperature; 180g castor sugar; 4 large eggs; finely grated zest of one lemon; 100g fresh or frozen blueberries, puréed. How to: Pulse the biscuits in a food processor until fine. Mix in the butter and then press the mixture over the base of a 20-cm round springform cake tin (not up the sides). Refrigerate the base while you make the filling. Set the NeoChef to 140 °C on Convection Setting. In a bowl, mix the cream cheese, sour cream, sugar, eggs and lemon zest until smooth. Transfer 60ml of the batter to a separate bowl and mix in the blueberry purée. Carefully pour the plain batter onto the biscuit base, then swirl the blueberry batter over the top and use a knife or skewer to incorporate the blueberry batter into the cheesecake to create a ripple effect. Bake for about 45 minutes or until the cheesecake is set and the middle is still slightly wobbly. Turn off the NeoChef, open the door slightly and leave the cheesecake to gradually cool in there until it reaches room temperature. Then refrigerate for at least four hours before unmoulding, slicing and serving.
