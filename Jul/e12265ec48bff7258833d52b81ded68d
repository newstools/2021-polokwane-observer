ACE Models competed against each other for the honour to represent the Limpopo Central branch in September 2021 at the ACE National Conference in Pretoria, where all the ACE Models branches across South Africa (over 25 of them) will come together and compete against each other. There were seven age categories for the Miss & Mr ACE Models Limpopo Central competition and over 35 models entered. The Top seven contestants were chosen by four neutral judges namely Jason Stander (Fitness Model and Optometrist), Mapula Legodi (Mrs Polokwane 2020), Refilwoe Mphahlele (Fashion Designer and Manager on Miss Limpopo board) and Dewald Hayens (Entrepreneur and Interior Designer). The owner of ACE Models Limpopo Central, Wilhrisca Jardine is proud of the models. “I am satisfied with the outcome of the competition, even though the Top 3 received certificates only the winner in every category was awarded with a sash, gift bag and a crown or a trophy.” Results: • Miss Tiny (four to six years): Kgaogelo Muronga. • Miss Petite (seven to nine years): Bokang Mojela. • Miss Pre-Teen (10 to 12 years): Onthatile Mogadime. • Miss Teen (13 to 15 years): Mmasape Manthata • Miss ACE Model (16+ years): Refilwe Malatji. • Mr Junior (four to 15 years): Risana Ngobeni. • Mr ACE Model (16 + years): Kgothatso Mokoele.
