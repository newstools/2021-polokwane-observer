Pothole repairs are an ongoing maintenance process undertaken by the municipality. This is according to Municipal Spokesperson, Thipa Selala, who earlier confirmed that various teams were stationed across town to repair potholes, repaint markings and other maintenance issues. He said that some of the potholes would be filled with sand as a preliminary measure while the team that would refill the pothole with tar attends to a different section of the town. A week ago, Polokwane Observer reported a pothole to the municipality on the corner of Bodenstein and Oost streets, and as Selala promised, this pothole was refilled a week later. According to the municipal website the Roads and Storm water Department is responsible for the maintenance of roads and streets, storm water systems, railway sidings, buildings and office space. They can be contacted for assistance on (015) 290 2088.
