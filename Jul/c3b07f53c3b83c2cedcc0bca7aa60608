This is a good question and one on which many books and articles have been written. This also applies to the question about which brand offers the best performance and durability. It is not the intention of this article to address all the elements and variables within the aforementioned questions, but rather just to provide some points to ponder before parting with your hard-earned cash. • Why do you want a 4×4? Do you plan just the occasional off-roading or is it your intention to make adventure off-road travel a regular item on your calendar? Will it be weekend-focused or longer trips, across South Africa or even into Africa?
• How deep is your pocket? A new 4×4 vehicle will set you back R450 000 plus, and then you still need to consider off-road accessories…
• Knowing the answer to these questions will direct you towards the most appropriate brand and the accessories required.
• Do you buy new or pre-owned? Both have advantages. Pre-owned will save you money and you may be able to buy a well-kitted, or at least partly kitted, vehicle at less the price of a new vehicle. New may well give you greater peace of mind because of better warranties.  • There are many 4×4 brands on the market, and deciding which to buy dictates that you really do your homework and test drive those you shortlist. Important thought: do not err by disregarding the non-traditional brands.
• Petrol or diesel? Petrol maybe cheaper and diesel vehicles may well be considered to offer better longevity and torque at crawling speed in difficult off-road conditions, but for some, it is six of one and half a dozen of the other. Consult with people skilled in the art of off-roading and/or adventure travel. The banter around a braai may cost you school money and disappointment.
• Do you want to employ the 4×4 bakkie/SUV as a tow vehicle? If so, engine power, torque and tow capacity are important considerations. Vehicles offering trailer stability control should be shortlisted, and be sure to study in detail the Road Traffic Act of 1996. Articles 222, 239 and 330 are of particular importance.
• Service and maintenance on 4×4 vehicles, especially if used under heavy conditions, is critical and can be expensive, so be sure to provide for this in your 4×4 adventure travel budget. Happy 4×4-ing… Photos: MotorPics / QuickPic
