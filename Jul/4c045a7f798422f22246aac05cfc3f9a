Polokwane Review and Polokwane Observer, are award winning, dynamic publications that are naturally interested in the progress and prosperity of the community they serve. Hard hitting, factual accurate community news give us the edge and to further our digital footprint in the province we will combine both publication’s websites into one. Observer joined the Northern Media Group publication stable after it was acquired by Caxton & CTP Publishers and Printers in April 2020.
