Global research shows that over the next five to ten years, the democratisation of technology will be front and centre. Democratisation essentially means that people will be provided easy access to technical or business expertise, without extensive and costly training. In simpler terms, it is ‘citizen access’ to technologies. However, for this to be successful, affordability will be key. The arrival of the Covid-19 pandemic in South Africa exposed severe shortcomings in this regard … particularly with the advantaged youth’s access to much-needed technology. Hundreds of thousands of school learners and university students, many whom come from disadvantaged backgrounds, were unable to access online study materials for remote learning purposes because they could not afford devices. Research also shows that what millennial and Gen Z consumers – many of them students – want from their phones is technology that’s able to enhance their social connection experience – as you would imagine, this comes high on their list of priorities. Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Helo are popular in this market, with every user wanting the ability to be a creator on their smartphone. Which makes the launch itel Mobile’s Vision1 Pro entry-level smart phone in our country so exciting. From the Chinese smartphone brand TECNO Mobile, owned by TRANSSION, the phone, which comes in at R1699 – far more affordable than competitors in this sector of the smartphone market – comes with a 32GB storage memory and 2GB RAM, and a 6.5 inch HD + Drop display, as well as an 8MP + QVGA rear camera and 5MP front camera. Face unlock and fingerprint sensors feature as well. More stats … the phone harnesses a HD+ 6.5-inches Waterdrop Fullscreen display, and it is powered by a quad-core UNISOC CPU that supports 4G LTE network. So basically, it offers the same features as higher-end flagship models do. Details: itel-mobile.com
