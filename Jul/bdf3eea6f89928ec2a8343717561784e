Serves 4-6 You’ll need: McCain Mexican Stir Fry; 600g beef rump cut into strips; 2 tablespoons vegetable oil; 1 large onion sliced; wraps. For the Fajita spice mix: 1 teaspoon garlic powder; 2 teaspoons cumin powder; 1 teaspoon oregano; 1 teaspoon chilli flakes; 1 teaspoon smoked paprika; 1 teaspoon paprika; 1 teaspoon black pepper; 1 teaspoon salt. For the guacamole: 2 avocados; juice of 1 lime; 1 teaspoon salt; ½ cup onions, chopped; 1 small tomato, diced; half bunch chopped coriander; 1 teaspoon minced garlic; ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional). How to: Combine all the ingredients in the fajita spice mix and set aside. In a bowl, mash the avocados, salt and lime juice, add the chopped onions, tomato, coriander, garlic and cayenne pepper if using. Taste and season with more salt and pepper if needed. Refrigerate the guacamole. Season the beef strips with two teaspoons of the fajita spice mix. Heat a frying pan on high heat and add oil. Once the oil is hot, fry the beef strips in batches – two minutes per batch and set aside. In the same pan add the onion and McCain Hawaiian Stir Fry Mix and two teaspoons of the fajita spice mix. Allow to cook on high heat for about 10 minutes until the water has dried up, once cooked remove from the heat and add the cooked beef rumps. Spread some of the guacamole on a wrap and top with the beef, veg mix and wrap. Serve with McCain chips * Recipe and image by McCain.
