“Now, we can scale Pedestrian Defense across our entire fleet and offer riders and cities something no other company has: a real-time solution to aggressive and unlawful riding,” said Assaf Biderman, the CEO of Superpedestrian. ”The new system doesn’t just detect unsafe behaviours like riding on the sidewalk, but puts a stop to them in real time in order to prevent serious injuries. The safety breakthrough is made possible through the acquisition of Navmatic, and the application of their patented Super Fusion technology, which combines multiple sources of real-time vehicle dynamics data to yield the most accurate, practical and reliable fleet positioning and vehicle control available today.” This technology solves many of the challenges involved with shared e-scooters. Pedestrian Defense will stop unsafe behaviours, like if sidewalk riding, wrong-way riding, aggressive swerving and repeated hard braking are detected, then immediately correct it by slowing or safely stopping the scooter in real time. “Only with Superpedestrian have we found the combination of a company that owns a leading sensing technology and that shares our passion to make cities safer,” said Boaz Mamo, the CEO and founder of Navmatic.  The Pedestrian Defense active safety system will:
• Detect a range of dangerous behaviours, such as riding on the sidewalk, riding the wrong way down a one-way street, aggressive swerving, and repeated hard braking
• Correct bad behaviour by immediately slowing or safely stopping a ride autonomously
• Alert riders violating rules with lights and audible notifications on the vehicle
• Educate riders with customised SMS alerts, in-app trainings, and incentives
• Inform cities with data and insights about safety conditions, including customised dashboards that identify locations with repeated errant behaviour
• Generate collision reports that provide authorities with detailed information in the case of a crash. At the end of each ride, all riders will receive a Safety Rating that chronicles both unsafe and safe behaviours. This individual Safety Rating is used to deliver customised in-app and SMS safety training. As ride behaviour improves, riders receive discounts on their future rides. Source: Influenceassociates.com
