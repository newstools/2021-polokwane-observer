With minimal effort, you can turn your toddler’s bedroom into a safe place where they can not only sleep at night but play, learn, and explore. Here’s how: Carefully consider all furniture in your toddler’s bedroom. Is your child able to move around freely without cabinets, storage boxes, or tables blocking their way? If their room is crowded with too many bulky items of furniture, you may have to move a few pieces into another room or store them in the garage. Make sure all items inside your toddler’s bedroom are accessible. An open shelving unit is ideal because it allows you to rotate and display a few toys or books your toddler can choose to engage with every few days. It also makes things easier when it’s time to pack up your child’s toys at the end of the day. Don’t shy away from colourful scatter cushions, curtains, bedspread sets, or wall art that engage your toddler’s imagination for fear they’ll outgrow them. These items can easily be replaced as your child grows older. Top tip: Decorating on a budget? Reuse your child’s artwork by framing them and putting them up on the wall, or even pinning them up as a display. Small details can make a big difference to a toddler’s bedroom. An interesting light, a fun bedside rug or lamp, some quirky knobs on a dresser can turn a drab room into a fab room. Set up an activity station with a small kiddies’ table and chair where your toddler can get crafty by building puzzles, playing with Lego, drawing, painting, and so on. A big floor cushion, some book ledges to display his books, even a teepee to crawl into make for the perfect hideaway for your little one to relax and discover the joy of books.
