Stellantis is the result of a merger of equals (Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Peugeot S.A. ‘Groupe PSA’). It represents no less than 72 dealerships and nine brands. These are Alfa Romeo, Fiat, Citroen, Jeep, Opel, Peugeot, Abarth and Fiat Professional.  “We’re delighted by the South African media’s recognition and admiration of Stellantis,” said Leslie Ramsoomar, managing director of Stellantis South Africa. “Not only is the media an important constituency for us, enabling us to get our story out to South African consumers and industry stakeholders, but it is a proud endorsement for us of the efforts that go into creating the ultimate customer experience across our brands.” “Stellantis’ professional managerial style and incredible knowledge displayed during all launches, the company’s commitment to journalists and customers alike, and passionate commitment to all the brands in the group amongst the criteria considered for the award,” said SAGMJ’s chairman, Carl Wepener. “The professional conduct and attention given by senior management to every journalist, irrespective of stature and seniority, when attending vehicle launches as well as granting interviews, is a sign of their dedication.”
