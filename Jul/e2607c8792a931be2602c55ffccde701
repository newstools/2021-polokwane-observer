It’s easy to forget the basics that make a road trip safer for everyone in an era when cars are equipped with advanced computer systems and insured with helpful policies. The good news is that you don’t need to be a mechanic to get back on the road safely. When traveling with children, keep these simple items on hand for a smoother car experience: Almost all cars can benefit from modern jump starter kits. These can be safely tucked away in the cubbyhole until you need them, thanks to their own built-in battery pack. You’ll never have to rely on a stranger to jump-start your car again. In no time, you’ll be on the road. Add a convenient, portable tyre inflator to take it to the next level. You’ll never have to deal with a flat tyre again if you plug it into your phone charger. There are also a variety of non-mechanical tyre jacks and other products that may be more suitable for your vehicle. Your car can quickly suffer if you travel with small children. You can clean up the worst of the mess with baby wipes and a small crumb brush before it sinks into the upholstery. To act as a waste bin, tie a shopping bag around the gear shift or the back of a chair. This will reduce the temptation to throw everything on the floor. If you frequently travel with a booster seat, make sure that your child is always safely strapped in.
