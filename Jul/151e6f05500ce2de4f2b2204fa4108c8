Serves 4 You’ll need: 3 Tbsp oil; 1 onion, finely chopped; 2 garlic cloves, crushed; 400g beef strips; 2 tsp paprika; 1 red pepper, chopped; 250g white mushroom, sliced; pinch of salt; pinch of black pepper; 1 Tbsp fresh parsley; * 500ml basic creamy white sauce; 2 x 73g Maggi 2-Minute Beef flavour noodles, already made. How to: Heat the oil in a pan and fry the onion and garlic and cook for four to five minutes. Increase the heat and add the beef strips. Fry for three minutes. Add the paprika, red pepper and mushroom and cook for three minutes. Set aside * To make the white sauce – Melt four tablespoons of butter in a big frying pan or a wide pot. When it’s bubbling add four tablespoons of flour. Mix the butter and flour with a wooden spoon until they form a thick paste. Cook, stirring, for about a minute over low heat. Don’t let the paste brown (it should be yellow in colour). Add about 1/3 cup of milk and whisk vigorously until the milk has been completely absorbed by the flour-butter paste. Keep adding the remaining milk, 420ml, in ½ cup amounts. Whisk thoroughly after each addition and wait until the milk is combined with the sauce. Mix vigorously especially at the beginning, to make sure that no lumps form. Cook the sauce for two to five minutes on the lowest heat until thickened. Keep in mind that the sauce will still thicken after taking the pot off the heat. Remove the pot from the heat. Season with salt, pepper and a big pinch of nutmeg. Add the sauce to the beef and mushroom mixture and stir until combined. Cook for two minutes. Top with the fresh parsley and serve with the Maggi 2-Minute Noodles. * Recipe & image by  Maggi.
