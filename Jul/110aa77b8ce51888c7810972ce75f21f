Sometimes professional help might be needed to help parents and their kids through some major changes. Puberty and the need for assertion see major behavioural changes in many teens. The lack of appropriate tools to navigate this stage could lead a teen down the wrong life path. At its extremes, teen blues can lead to behaviours such as: According to clinical psychologist Benedict Mhlongo, “teens are susceptible to toxic behaviour as a form assertion”. Many parents try to understand their teens to better support them. These attempts may fail, and some seek out support from professionals. Substance abuse and suicide prevent are big themes when it comes to parenting a teen, and when parents see red flags, support is required. Mental health services don’t come cheap for the average South African without medical aid. Even the ones on affordable plans consider the usage of their medical savings and seeing a psychologist might compromise that.
