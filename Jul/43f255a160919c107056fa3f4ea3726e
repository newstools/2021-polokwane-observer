Hats are key accessories in a man’s wardrobe. They’re practical, protecting from sun, wind and rain, and adaptable, meaning that they can finish off a variety of looks, from casual to classy and eclectic. While most styles are wearable all year round, these five are winter staples… Possibly the most versatile of all hat styles, this nifty knitted accessory can take you from streetwear to sleek wear. It easily transcends seasons – choose wool in winter and a lightweight material in summer. Some styles fit snuggly, others are slouchy – it’s a matter of personal taste. Colourwise, we recommend going for a neutral like navy, black or grey to get the most wear out of it. Bucket hats are back thanks to the 90s revival and celebs like Justin Bieber. Made from heavy-duty cotton fabrics such as denim and canvas, they’re a street style favourite and look great with laidback items such as bomber jackets, high tops and jerseys. There are so many versions of this, including the original fitted cap, dad hat, snapback and five-panel hat. Whatever style you choose, you’ll be able to wear it all-year-round with any casual gear (skip the cap, jeans and blazer look – it’s dated). Originally associated with gangsters in the 1920s, the fedora has had a long history and today, this firm felt-brimmed hat is a favourite among dapper dressers who exude class. Choose a neutral tone and medium brim for best results. Despite its humble, country beginnings, the flat cap has become an urban favourite that adds charm to smart-casual looks. It’s typically made from wool, tweed or cotton and is lined for extra comfort and warmth, making it ideal for colder weather. * Source: thetrendspotter.net and fashionbeans.com; pic from unsplash.com
