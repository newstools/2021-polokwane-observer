There’s nothing more satisfying than making a warm pot of soup, especially if it is this quick and easy. Serves 6 You’ll need: 100g uncooked rice vermicelli noodles; 1 tablespoon canola oil; ½ cup thinly sliced shallots; 4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced; 1 medium chilli, sliced; 1 tablespoon red curry paste; 1 teaspoon ginger; 1½ teaspoons curry powder; 4 cups chicken stock; 400ml coconut milk; 3 tablespoons cold water; 2 tablespoons cornstarch; 500g cooked skinless, boneless chicken breast, shredded; 170g sugar snap peas, diagonally sliced; 1 teaspoon salt; ½ cup chopped fresh coriander; ¼ cup chopped spring onions; ¼ cup unsalted cashews, toasted and chopped. How to: Cook noodles according to package directions, rinse with cold water, drain and set aside Heat oil in a large pan or wok over medium heat. Add shallots, garlic, chilli and ginger and fry gently for about four minutes making sure not to burn any of the ingredients. Stir in curry paste and curry powder and cook for a further minute. Add stock and coconut milk and bring to a simmer. Combine three tablespoons of cold water and cornstarch in a small bowl. Add cornstarch mixture, shredded chicken breast, snap peas and salt to the pan and simmer for two minutes or until thickened. Place about a third of a cup of noodles in each of six bowls and top with one cup stock mixture. Garnish with chopped coriander, spring onions and cashew nuts. * Recipe & image by Capsicum Culinary Studio.
