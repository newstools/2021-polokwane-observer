Modiba went to Mentz, outside Mankweng, to donate soccer boots and apparel thanks to his sponsor, Adidas. The lucky recipients were his former club, Hungry Lions, and his alma mater, Makgefola Primary School. Modiba said he wants aspiring football players at his school to enjoy their favourite sporting code without any hindrances. “We always try to visit as many communities as we can, not only where we are from, but anywhere we can help. Where they need our help, we always try and help. We will still do more good things for the community of Limpopo,” he added. Modiba started playing football in the dusty streets of Mentz a decade ago and is a 2015 graduate of the Nedbank Cup’s Ke Yona Team Search. The programme was aimed at identifying talented soccer players in the country and providing them with an opportunity to play for professional teams. Modiba was one of the few players who made it from the programme and the feat saw him join Mpumalanga Black Aces in the 2014/15 Premier Soccer Leaue season.
