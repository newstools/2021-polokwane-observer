“The South African market is an important right-hand-drive market for the company, which is evident in the latest technology products being available to the local market,” said Karl-Heinz Göbel, CEO of JAC Motors South Africa. “Just a few weeks ago, we delivered our new N55 EV battery-electric truck to an ecstatic customer.” JAC Motors South Africa also showed a remarkable sales performance on local shores, realising the exact sales numbers for the first semester of 2021 as recorded for the entire 2020 calendar year. Since its market inception in 2017, its sales steadily grew despite new car sales declining by 2,8% and 21,9% in 2019 and 2020. The brand currently boasts a dealer footprint of more than 50 dealers across South Africa and Namibia. “The inspiring performance of our brand globally means that the latest technology products, like the exciting, all-new T9 2.5-litre turbo-diesel large body double-cab, will soon be introduced in the local market,” concluded Göbel.
