Detective Superintendent Roy Grace is back in Peter James’ Left You Dead. And, for the first time in his career, he’s involved in a case that’s left him totally confounded. He’s investigating the disappearance of a woman who, after a Sunday outing visiting country houses with her husband, stops off at the supermarket to buy some cat litter. While he sits and waits in the car, she dashes in … and that’s the last anyone sees of her. With no word from her, and no information gathered from family and friends, he, despite vigorously protesting his innocence, is arrested on suspicion of her murder. But as Grace discovers, nothing’s really as it originally seemed. Lovers of a good crime novel probably already read Peter James … if not, now’s a great time to start. Pan Macmillan, available at Exclusive Books.  It’s so thrilling when you pick up a book, and then just can. not. put. it down. Hello Anna Wharton’s The Imposter. It’s the story of Chloe … quiet, unassuming, struggling a little in her job as a newspaper archivist as she has to take time off to look after her grandmother. She’s happy enough reading about the lives of others … and is particularly interested in the story of Angie Kyle, a girl her own age who disappeared when she was a child, a child whose parents never gave up hope of finding her. When Chloe’s nan is moved into care, and her house sold, Chloe is literally homeless, and in desperation, answers an advert for a lodger in the missing girl’s home. Moving in, she thinks she may get closer to the story she’s read so much about. But these parents are slightly off … and with everyone appearing to have something to hide, the tension grows with every page. PanMacmillan.
