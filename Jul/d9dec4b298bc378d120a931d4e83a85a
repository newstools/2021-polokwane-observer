There is only so much that you, as a parent, can do to keep your child safe. After all, you can’t keep an eye on them or be with them all the time. With schools closing early due to the Covid-19 pandemic and tighter lockdown rules, reviewing safety rules with your children is a good idea. Teach your kids not to talk to strangers or go places with them, no matter how friendly they are. Tell your child that it’s fine to say “no” if someone bothers them or makes them feel threatened. Insist that if this happens, they tell you, or a trusted adult. Never leave your child alone at a park, shopping mall, or any other public area. While it’s best that parents accompany them on all outings, if this is not possible, only allow them to go with an adult you know well and who you trust. Your child should never be opening the gate, or door, to anyone without asking you first. Teach your child to ask who it is and inform you or anyone else who is with them before opening the door or gate to your property. Make sure your child fastens his or her seatbelt before getting in the car, and that he or she remains seated at all times. Teach your child to get in and out of the car after it has come to a complete stop. Teach your child how to cross the street safely.
