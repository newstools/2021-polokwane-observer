Redelinghuys was in charge of the Limpopo Blue Bulls female team since 2008 and has given plenty of aspiring hardworking female players from rural areas a platform to showcase their rugby talent on a national level. His last match was on Saturday when he helped his charges to beat Mpumalanga Pumas 71-0. The legendary 64-year-old mentor says he wants to spend time with his family. “I am not getting any younger and I just want to spend time with my wife and grandchildren. I wasn’t able to spend enough time with my family because of my commitment to rugby and often being away with the team, especially on weekends. I think now is the time to settle and focus on my family.” He said he was happy to have contributed to the careers of junior Springbok players who hail from Limpopo. Some of the junior Springboks who were under his tutelage are Mpho Moloto, Sarah Ramoswari, Rights Mkhari, Annatacia Mashiane and Valencia Mthembi. “I am happy to have contributed to their careers. They have done well in the Springbok jersey and I am happy to have been part of their development and to have contributed to their success,” he concluded.
