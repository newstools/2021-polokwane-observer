When painting a kitchen table, you need to make sure your paintwork can withstand the wear and tear of daily life. Whether your dining table is going to double up as a desk for homework or working from home, it needs to be hardwearing. After taking the time to paint it, you want to take the necessary steps to make it last. To create a durable finish, you need a varnish that is strong enough to seal and protect your paintwork. That’s where Chalk Paint™ Lacquer comes it. This water-based varnish is robust enough to hold up against daily use, whether you choose a matt or gloss finish. It also goes on perfectly clear and dries quickly without yellowing over time.
