Are you are looking for easy art ideas for kids? Fill a box with a variety of collected materials your kids will love creating items with. Here’s how… Keep aside some items that you would usually throw away such as cardboard roll holders, empty egg cartons, or even little empty matchboxes. Children love to paint and decorate these items and you should try to have them available when needed. Look out for sales where you can purchase arts and crafts supplies at lower prices. Thrift shops also offer a great variety of mismatched wool, pipe cleaners, colourful felt and fabric, buttons, rattail cords, washi tape, sequins, beads, cut-off paper, and other odd items (such as old socks), you can purchase at next-to-nothing prices. You can include crayons, pencils, paint, and paintbrushes, felt tip pens, paper, glitter, glue, a safe pair of children’s scissors, stickers, etc., in your child’s arts and crafts box. Remember that the more you add, the more options your child will have to explore his or her creativity. Instead of buying a box to keep your supplies in, make one yourself or at least with your child! For example, find an old shoebox. Allow your child to paint and decorate it and personalise it to her taste. Let her keep it in her room as a reminder of the fun that lies inside. And lastly, don’t forget to offer praise and admiration!
