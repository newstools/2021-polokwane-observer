Many of us are still living, working and exercising in one space and it’s awakened a new desire for decluttered spaces and a sense of minimalism in all aspects of our lives. We’re spring cleaning our homes, wardrobes, desk spaces and looking for opportunities to simplify our lives. This desire for a less-is-more approach has extended into skincare and grooming regimes but doesn’t mean washing your face with whatever soap you have lying around and hoping for the best. “It takes commitment, consistency and care to find the right products for your skin,” says Themba Ndlovu from Clere For Men., Recent research from Karlstad University in Sweden found that men between the ages 15 to 45 are taking more control of their appearance and embracing ideas of self-care and minimalist skincare routines. However, some men still won’t adopt a daily face care routine because they think it will get too expensive. Shop locally and affordably now and you’ll prevent skin and ageing issues later on. * Source: Some information supplied on behalf of Clere for Men, clereformen.co.za
