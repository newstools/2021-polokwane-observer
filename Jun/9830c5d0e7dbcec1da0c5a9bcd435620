“There is no timeframe for reporting noise pollution.” According to Police Spokesperson, Brig Motlafela Mojapelo, residents can report complaints of noise pollution in residential areas at any time of the day and a team of officers will be dispatched to attend the scene. This comes after a concerned resident told Polokwane Observer on how she contacted the police station to alert them of a party at their neighbours that left her windows rattling. “Even my deaf dog could feel the vibrations caused by the music and was traumatised. When I called the police all I wanted was for them to get my neighbours to turn the volume down and be considerate of the rest of us in the street. I was also worried about our other neighbours who have young children.” She says when she called the police the first time at around 17:00 she was told that it was too early to report noise pollution to which she insisted to be directed to a different person who would be willing to assist. “After the call was transferred, the officer told me that they would do something about it. An hour later I was still sitting trying to calm my dogs because of the noise becoming louder and louder. That was when I decided to call the Community Policing Forum (CPF).” She says when she called the CPF, she was told that the police have a shortage of vans and would rather attend to a more serious scene than one of noise pollution. Brig Mojapelo refuted this, saying the station has no shortage of vans and that no officer is allowed to tell residents that there are no vans available.
