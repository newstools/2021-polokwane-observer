Better know as TeeKay, his dad is still alive but hasn’t been a part of their lives for a long time, that it actually feels like they do not have a father. “Due to circumstances my dad walked out on us and left me with the responsibility of being a dad and making sure I take care for my siblings. It is very challenging to try and take care of siblings more especially when they get older, because at that age everyone things they know what’s best for them.” TeeKay says as much as he enjoys being there for his siblings he sometimes wonders what life would have been if his dad was more present in their lives. especially now with Father’s Day. As much as he plays the father role in his siblings’ lives, he is not exactly considered their father. He says Father’s Day is bitter-sweet for them because as much as it is a time to celebrate fathers for them it is a reminder of something they don’t have. Despite this, TeeKay and his siblings always make the best of it. “Because of how young I am, society does not consider me a father to my siblings, despite the sacrifices I have made for them. But, despite all of this I always make sure I keep the promise I made to myself all those years ago to be the best father that they deserve. A father who is always there for them when they need me.” TeeKay says he would never swap being a dad for anything, because it gives him fulfillment and direction.
