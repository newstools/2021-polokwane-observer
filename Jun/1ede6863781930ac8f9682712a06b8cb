Just right for winter in South Africa, the Gold Rush perfectly pairs the sweetness of honey, the light refreshment of lemon and oaky notes of Bourbon. It is really easy to prepare. Just blend 44ml/2 parts Bourbon with 22ml/1 part honey syrup and 22ml/1 part freshly squeezed lemon juice. Garnish with lemon zest to make the most of the citrus aroma. The versatility of American Whiskeys makes them the ideal foundation for cocktails. They pair beautifully with winter citrus fruit juices in classic American cocktails.
