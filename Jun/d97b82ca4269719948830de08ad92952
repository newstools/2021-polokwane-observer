During these uncertain times of the Covid Pandemic, we are all more aware of our health and are looking for ways to stay healthy and prevent us from getting sick. Do you want to feel more healthy, have more energy, feel better about how you look, and even add years to your life? Get off the couch and into your tekkies! We all need a balanced life – good eating habits, enough sleep, and regular exercise. The lack of regular exercise is recognised as the single most important contributing factor to mortality, more than obesity, smoking, diabetes and any other factors. Exercise does not necessarily mean you have to go to the gym. It can be any moderately intense activity, 30 minutes a day, 5 times a week (150 minutes per week). This can include aerobic exercises to fight disease, strengthening exercises to protect bones, easing back pain with flexibility exercises, and preventing falls with balance exercises. Regular physical activity at the correct intensity: Change the way you feel about exercise, challenge yourself with new exercise ideas and choose a new exercise lifestyle that makes you feel on top of the world. Exercise is more than just well-being, it is LIFE. For more information visit www.medwell.co.za
