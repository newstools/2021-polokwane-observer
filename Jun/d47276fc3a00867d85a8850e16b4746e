Speaking at the Capricorn Tourism Exhibition at Savannah Mall on Saturday, Mabusa says the region boasts some breathtaking attractions and citizens should make use of it. “We have the Ivory Route Camp found in Mafefe in the Lepelle Nkumpi area, we have Polokwane Game Reserve and the birds park in Polokwane which people can visit. There is no need for people to go outside the province when they want to visit tourist attractions. We have plenty of them in the region and we want the people to visit those areas. This is part of our efforts to promote domestic tourism.” She also added that the event gave local entrepreneurs in the arts and craft sector an opportunity to exhibit their products to local markets. “We had arts and crafts entrepreneurs on the day and they had the opportunity to showcase their products. Some were able to sell their goods to the shoppers at Savannah Mall.”
