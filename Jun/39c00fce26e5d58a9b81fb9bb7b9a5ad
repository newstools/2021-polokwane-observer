This cocktail is aromatic, with a touch of anise, cinnamon and clove. The MCC complements the flavour of the bourbon so you will get hints of vanilla and caramel from the bourbon, as well as the highlights of pear or crisp apple from the MCC. To make it, stir together 30ml/1 part Bourbon; 15ml/half part Cointreau; 4 dashes of aromatic bitters; 4 dashes of Creole bitters in an ice filled mixing glass. Strain into a chilled champagne flute and top with champagne or MCC. It’s just right for orange season, so garnish with a fresh twist of orange zest.
