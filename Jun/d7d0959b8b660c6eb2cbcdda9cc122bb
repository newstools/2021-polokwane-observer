The expo attracted 34 companies from various parts of the province which exhibited their products and sold some of their goods to the broader clientele in Polokwane. Event organiser, Lydia Olivier said the event was aimed at giving business owners in the province a platform to interact and learn from each other. “It is easy to do business with someone you have met. It is through such platforms that business owners are able to mingle and know each other on a personal level with the hope of fostering business relations.” She also thanked the citizens for coming to the event to procure and purchase some of the goods that were on sale. “The turnout was amazing. We had people from all walks of life who came to the expo to learn more,” Olivier said.
