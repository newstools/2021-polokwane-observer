Hello Groote Post’s The Old Man’s Blend Red 2019. This wine is a blend of 50 per cent Merlot and 25 per cent each Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz. “This is a fantastic vintage. The three varietals all reached optimal ripeness in perfect timing for the harvest”, says Lukas. This is a down-to-earth, ripe-fruit-driven blend. Captivating red fruit notes delight the senses, most notably cherry, raspberry and cranberry, with soft tannins giving a smooth finish. R215 from  from groote-post-wines.myshopify.com/collections/all.
