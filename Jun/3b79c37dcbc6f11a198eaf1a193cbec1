She owns a practice in Bendor with a special interest in balance and has encountered a number of cases of vestibular disorder. Magedi said the disorder can be treated, however, people are not aware that it exists to begin with. She further explained that vestibular (balance) disorder is a term used to umbrella many conditions. This affects the balance organ found in the inner ear called the vestibular system and parts of the central nervous system in the brain that communicate back and forth to help maintain balance. Magedi explained that vestibular disorders happen when disease, injury or aging damages the vestibular and central nervous system. “The symptoms of vestibular disorder include dizziness, vertigo, blurred vision, hearing loss, nausea, vomiting and aural fullness, which is the sensation of ear fullness. “Tinnitus, which is a ringing sound in the ear may also be another sign of a vestibular disorder,” she explained. She added that one can take a balance self-test which consists of ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer options and if you answer ‘yes’ to one question, you could be at risk. “This test is not a diagnosis, the best way to actually know if you have a problem is to consult a clinician who specialises in vestibular disorders for a detailed assessment,” she said. She added that for some people, having one of these symptoms does not affect their lives, however, if it gets to a point where it bothers you and affects your ability to perform daily activity, she urges that immediate action must be taken.
