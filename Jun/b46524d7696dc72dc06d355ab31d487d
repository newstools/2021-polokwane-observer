She is a model by profession and currently a finalist of Miss Legacy World South Africa. “I am part of Ace Models Limpopo Central as well as a signed model at Ice Models. Ever since I was 13 years old, I wanted to start an initiative of giving young unprivileged girls and women sanitary towels and bring an end to period poverty. It is for this reason that I took a step and started my own sanitary towel campaign known as the GirlPowerDrive Campaign.” She explains this campaign does not only donate pads but also educate girls on important information they need to know such as menstruation, sexual intercourse and self-worth. “I call it Girl Talk. For the past few months I have been collecting money and donations from people as well as looking for sponsors. On 18 June I went to visit Matsobane Primary School in Ga-Mphahlele and it has been such an honour giving the Gr 6’s and 7’s a Girls Talk as well as donating pads. It is so heartwarming to be able to put a smile on every one of those girls’ faces. I decided to adopt these girls, meaning that every single year I will be donating sanitary towels and hopefully more to them. My motto to accept your pasts without regrets, handle your presence with confidence and face your future without fear.”
