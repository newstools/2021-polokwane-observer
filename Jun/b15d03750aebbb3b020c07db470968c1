From rugby legend to businessman, wine farmer, cultural custodian, musician, father and grandfather, Schalk memoir is an intensely personal and honest journey of the triumphs and hardships that have shaped the life of this much loved South African.  He is a storyteller extraordinaire, and he’ll have you snorting into your beer as you read about run ins with officialdom, fisticuffs on the field, how he became the first white Springbok selected from a Coloured team, and the day Cheeky Watson asked to wash his feet. This is a glimpse into the life and times of one of the country’s most recognise figures and told in the stories of the many lives that intersected with his. Jonathan Ball Publishers
