Serves 4 You’ll need: 500g potatoes (cut into even-sized pieces); 1 large egg (beaten); 1 cup cake flour (plus plenty extra for shaping/ dusting); a splash of olive oil; knob of butter for frying. For the sauce – ¼ cup extra virgin olive oil; 4 large garlic cloves (finely chopped); 400g tinned chopped tomatoes; ½ sachet green olives (halved and pitted); 3 anchovy fillets; 1 ½ teaspoons capers (drained); 1 teaspoon dried oregano; ½ teaspoon chilli flakes; basil leaves; parmesan (grated). How to: Steam the potatoes for 15-20 minutes until tender. Mash well, ideally with a ricer, which will give fluffier gnocchi. Add the egg and some seasoning, mix briefly with a fork, then sift over the flour and bring together to make dough. It should feel dry to the touch but not crumbly. Add more flour if needed, then knead a few times on a floured work surface. Bring a large pan of water to a boil. Split the dough into tennis-ball sized pieces, then roll into finger-width ropes. Dust with a little flour then cut into bite-sized pieces. Boil in batches for about 1 minute or until they bob to the surface. Lift from the pan with a slotted spoon and leave to cool in a single layer on a large plate or tray. Drizzle the oil over the cooled gnocchi and toss gently with your hands to coat. When ready to serve, heat the butter in a frying pan, then fry the gnocchi in a few batches until crisp and golden. Keep warm and serve. Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add tinned tomatoes, olives, anchovies, capers, oregano, and chilli flakes. Simmer sauce over medium-low heat until thickened, about 8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Toss the gnocchi in the pasta sauce and serve with basil and parmesan. * Recipe & image by RCL Foods.
