Cook your father’s favourite dish and shower him with laughter and memories, grandchildren and thoughtful gifts. If you don’t live near this special man in your life, order a meal from his favourite restaurant and have it delivered to him. Go for a lovely walk and stop for a family picnic. Check the weather forecast first. History and art lovers might enjoy visiting a museum; you can do this virtually around the world, and it makes a fun afternoon activity indoors. A sports-mad Dad would love company while watching an exciting game. Sending a loving handwritten message is often the most thoughtful way to show how much you love and appreciate your Dad. Let your parents know you’ll be gifting their next groceries and add all your Dad’s favourite treats; you could deliver a gift basket like this too. Fill a photo album with special photos or events so your Dad can reminisce anytime; this makes a great birthday or Christmas gift too.
