The confident duo shared that they have never had a once-off client – their food is too tasty to not become a regular. Their secret is Manamela who was a chef in Dubai but came home as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Having returned home, he had to make the decision to market himself to work for somebody else or start something that would be his own. This was when he collaborated with Senoamadi to start Minas and Chachas. Senoamadi explained that Minas and Chachas is a street language which refers to eating out. They started operating in March and business is booming. Because of the great response, they have employed two temporary workers who assist at the eatery. “We would like to be located in town but for a small business like us, rent in town would just be too expensive. And there’s just too much red tape to operate from elsewhere, hence we decided to work from the garage,” said Senoamadi. The duo is confident that they will grow big as the recognisable brands that are out there because they bring something different to the table. “We bring a different taste. We offer the same value as the bigger chains, just at more affordable prices,” he said. In future, Minas and Chachas will introduce a delivery service, making use of their own scooters and also make their eatery available on food delivery apps.
