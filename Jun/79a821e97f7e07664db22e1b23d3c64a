 When dealing with other people’s information you may only request data that is relevant to the business transaction, being the reason for the data collection, which must be explicitly stated to the person providing the information. Once you got what you needed and used the information, you have to discard it in a safe manner.  Penalties can be small, like a minor fine, but if the offence is serious, so are the consequences. I wouldn’t want to, but I will send you to jail if I have to. So, make sure that you learn everything there is to know about me, and we probably won’t have a problem.
