Serves 4 You’ll need: 1 tsp grated ginger; 2 tsp Durban masala; 2 tsp garlic flakes; 2 tsp salt; 3 large onions quartered and sliced; ¼ cup canola oil/ coconut oil or ghee; 2 cinnamon sticks, 1 tsp mustard seeds; 1 tsp jeera seeds; 500g butternut chunks; 500g sweet potato chunks; 1 tin of lentils, drained and rinsed; juice of 2 oranges; peel or zest of 1 orange; ½ tsp ground cinnamon; 1 tin (400ml) coconut cream; 1 bunch coriander, chopped. How to: Preheat the oven to 200˚C. Heat the oil and add the cinnamon sticks, mustard seeds and jeera seeds. Add the onions and cook for about 5-8 minutes, until soft. Add the ginger, garlic, masala and salt and fry for about 5 minutes. Lightly oil a casserole dish and layer all the butternut, sweet potato and lentils with the onion. Add the orange juice and peel/ zest, cinnamon, and drizzle over the coconut cream. Cover with foil and bake covered for 40 minutes, remove foil and bake for a further 30 minutes or until browned on top and thickened. Top with the chopped coriander and serve it with rice or roti. Cook’s notes: A tin of butter beans can be added to the bottom of the casserole dish as well. * Recipe and image by the Cook Culinary & Craft Studio.
