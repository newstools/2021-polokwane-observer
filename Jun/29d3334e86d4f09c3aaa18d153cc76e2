We’re big fans of TAU Game Lodge in the Madikwe Reserve. Early morning game drives looking for the Big Five, coffee with Amarula to beat the winter chill, afternoon (guilt-free) naps, followed by sundowners in the bush before a magical dinner, listening to elephants trumpet, or the bark of an African wild dog.  And now another reason to rave. The lodge is holding a special Gin Tasting Weekend this month. So added to all the special spoils you experience at this lodge is a tasting event with three gins. It’s all happening on June 26, and the rate includes two nights accommodation (25 and 26 June or 26 and 27 June – and you can add on nights if you wish), the gin tasting, three meals and two game drives a day, beverages during the game drives and all applicable levies.  The cost is R13 550 for two people, sharing), and excludes all items ordered from the bar, curio purchases, telephone usage, laundry services and all other extras.
