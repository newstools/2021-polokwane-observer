Every year, winter invites us to slow down and tune in to the naturally quieter time. This year, we need that gentle pause more than ever. Let’s face it, we’re Zoom’ed out, virtually frazzled, and missing that sense of whole-hearted connection to our loved ones. It’s time, we think, for a digital detox.  And it’s not just for us as always-on-the adults; our kids need a good break from screen time too. If you haven’t tried it before, this is the time to switch off. It’s easier than you imagine.  If you’re keen to escape the city at the same time, this special Spier detox sounds perfect.  A leisurely winter getaway in the Spier village-style hotel, loads of farm-fresh foods and delicious wines, with time to take a farm meander or a vineyard cycle in the crisp, clean country air. Read a book under an old oak tree and play together on smooth green lawns. Watch the sunset with a glass of red wine on the banks of the Eerste River. On arrival, you can lock up your phone in the safe, and then open the welcome pack … a journal and pencil, a disposable film camera to capture special moments, and an old-fashioned postcard to send to a friend or family. There’s also a signature wine-tasting voucher in each pack, and a bottle of Spier Signature Pinotage to enjoy in front of the cosy fire. This offer is available from now until the end of September this year. Use the promo code RECONNECT when you book on spier.co.za. And if you can’t get away … why not make up your own at-home-off-line pack, and spend the weekend reconnecting with your family and friends the old-fashioned way.
