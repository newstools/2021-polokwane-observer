Serves 4 You’ll need: 4 chicken thighs and 4 chicken drumsticks; 1 tablespoon taco seasoning; 1 jar tomato salsa (may substitute with 1 can chopped tomato & onion); 500 g pumpkin or butternut, seeded, peeled, cut into wedges; 1 red onion, cut into wedges; 3 red and yellow peppers, seeded, thinly sliced; 200 g mixed cherry tomatoes; 1 tablespoon avocado or olive oil; 1 avocado, stoned, peeled, thinly sliced. For the chilli-lime cream: 160g sour cream; 2 teaspoons chilli or hot sauce (optional); 1 tablespoon lime juice; fresh coriander; additional mashed avocado or guacamole to serve How to: Preheat oven to 200°C. In a large bowl toss the chicken thighs and drumsticks with the taco seasoning. Spoon tomato salsa over the base of a casserole dish. Arrange the pumpkin, onion, peppers and tomatoes over salsa. Top with chicken mixture. Drizzle with oil. Bake, turning occasionally, for 35-40 minutes or until the vegetables are tender and the chicken is golden brown and cooked through. Set aside for 5 minutes to rest. Meanwhile, to make the chilli-lime cream, combine sour cream, chilli sauce and lime juice in a small bowl. Season. Arrange the avocado and coriander over the chicken mixture in the pan. Serve with the chilli-lime cream and extra guacamole. * Recipe by the South African Avocado Growers’ Association.
