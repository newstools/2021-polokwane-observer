The plea comes after two separate issues are affecting supply, according to municipal spokesperson, Thipa Selala. “The municipality is working on fixing a burst pipe and restoring water supply to Ladanna, Welgelegen, the factories behind Ladanna as well as Hospital Park. The maintenance team has estimated five to six hours until completion of repairs and supply restoration,” he explained. Meanwhile, other areas within the municipality are experiencing water shortages due to low reservoir levels. “These include Moregloed, the upper parts of Sterpark and parts of Nirvana, including Dubai Street. Bendor and parts of Seshego, in particular Zone 3, are experiencing low pressure. Most reservoirs in the municipal area have not improved since last week,” Selala added. He urged water users to: “In the meantime, the municipality has deployed water tankers as a temporary relief measure to the affected areas. Normal water supply shall be restored once there is improvement in reservoir levels,” he concluded.
