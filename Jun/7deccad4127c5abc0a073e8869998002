Should food be a reason to choose a holiday destination. Yes. Yes. And YES. And when you hear about the foodie special that’s on at the wonderful Arniston Hotel and Spa, we know you’ll agree. From now until the end of July, guests at this hotel will have, included in their rate, a seafood platter for two. And when we say seafood platter, it’s a PLATTER. A feast of the fruits from the sea. A buffet breakfast is included, too (double helping of bacon for me please). And more good news … there’s a really tempting winter rate. Which is a brilliant reason in itself to visit this luxurious four-star hotel in the peaceful, sleepy village of Arniston, and which is internationally knows as one of the world’s best getaways. We don’t say that lightly … it’s won two Haute Grandeur Global Excellence Awards – Best Country Hotel in South Africa and Best Beach Hotel in South Africa. No wonder.  The setting is exquisite – think panoramic views of the ocean and the pristine coastline, the unspoiled, child-friendly beaches are safe and perfect for swimming and surfing, there’s a rather special spa, and there’s a 120-year-old picturesque fishing village of Kassiesbaai – a Grade One Heritage Site, to explore.  The winter rate is R895 a person sharing, which includes breakfast and a seafood feast. Plus .. if you’ve children younger than 12, two of them can stay for free. This is only from Sunday to Thursday nights, until the end of July 2021. Details and bookings:  028 445 9000.
