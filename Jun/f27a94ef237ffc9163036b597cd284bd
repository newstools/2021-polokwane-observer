“London Electric Cars aims to transform the face of electric vehicle ownership and electric-powered conversions of classic cars from petrol power. Founded in 2017, the company is on a mission to create sustainably converted classic cars using electric power, with real-life EV mileage predictions based on real-world city driving and in-car usage, such as stereos and heaters.” The LEC Mini comes with a 20kWh system that can drive an estimated 90-110 kilometers on a full charge.  Matthew Quitter, founder and managing director of London Electric Cars, said, “As a classic car enthusiast and advocate for affordable and sustainable electric vehicle conversions, it made sense for LEC to focus on the original Mini. Alec Issigonis was one of the most collaborative and free-thinking designers, but also someone who knew how to stick to a budget. With this EV conversion, we wanted the classic Mini to be an affordable yet useful option for city dwellers, not just in our home town of London, but all over the world, to tackle traffic and help put a stop to pollution.” The owner of a London Electric Cars converted classic Mini said, “It’s everything I’ve ever wanted and more. Not only does my classic Mini have a new lease on life, but it’s perfect for running around London and so cheap to run! No more worrying if I’ve forgotten to pay the congestion charge and there are so many public charging points around. It really is a win-win.” Source: Newspress
