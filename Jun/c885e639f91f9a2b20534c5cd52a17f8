If there’s one technique that Annie Sloan returns to time and again, it’s the two-colour distress method she developed right when she first created Chalk Paint™ In just a few simple steps, you can create an authentic distressed effect. Make it your own with your choice of colours and the amount of sanding you go for. Like uncovering layers of paint on an old piece of furniture, this effect gives the illusion of paint work that has been enjoyed for decades. But instead of waiting generations, you can achieve this vintage look in the matter of hours! You can be quite playful with your colour choice, perhaps using something quite bright as a base coat. But there’s no reason not to stick with a more muted, traditional palette. Step-by-step guide to the two-colour distressed paint effect  You can watch the video here: https://www.anniesloan.com/techniques/how-to-create-a-two-colour-distress-using-chalk-paint/ Creating a distressed paint effect is simple but the real creativity will come out in your colour choices and the way you sand the finished piece. Most importantly, have fun with it! Your brushstrokes and the way you sand back the paint are what will make your piece unique to you and your home. Say goodbye to mass-produced, anonymous furniture and hello to something that is as uniquely yours as that beautiful old piece of furniture that has been handed down through your family for generations.
