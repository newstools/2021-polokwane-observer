This the third generation Haval H6 boasts. Haval calls it “five-dimensional upgrades in terms of design, intelligence, power, safety and comfort”, which thus promises an excellent driving experience. Haval’s LEMON platform allows for more strength at a lower weight. Haval claims this H6 is the only SUV that can activate autonomous emergency braking in all driving scenarios, and is the best-in-class SUV with its supersensitive and cutting-edge intelligent cockpit.   The interior presents the driver with oriental styling and a virtual dashboard. “All models have been fitted with, among other features, Full-Speed-Range Adaptive Cruise Control and Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) assisting the driver to further abide by the rules of the road and ensure passengers’ safety. Traffic Jam Assist (TJA) offers the driver the option to engage cruise control in bumper-to-bumper traffic. Its 12,3-inch super intelligent touchscreen and the 10,25-inch super intelligent full-colour instrument panel allows for seamless vehicle interactions.” The H6 is fitted with an all-new 2.0 GDIT (petrol direct injection turbo) engine, 150kW. Power is pushed to the road via a 7DCT transmission.  It also boasts the latest 9.3 Gen electronic stability programme (ESP), HD 360 Degree View Camera, Lane Departure Warning and Lane-keeping Assist, an All-round Blind Spot Monitoring system as well as Tyre-pressure Monitoring System, six airbags and more. This means that owners not just get value for their buck, but an SUV that will excel on all levels – performance, safety and luxury. There will be four derivatives and pricing starts at R419 900. This includes a five-year or 100 000km warranty as well as a five-year/60 000km service plan. Source: Quickpic
