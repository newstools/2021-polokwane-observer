Beat the winter blues this weekend with three marvellous movies… Start with an epic adventure animation about a headstrong young girl who befriends a wild mustang with the same rebellious spirit as her; grab the popcorn for a science-fiction thriller about a global event that wipes out all electronics and takes away humankind’s ability to sleep; and get ready for an action-comedy about a flamboyant super-villain who gathers a collection of misfits to form a motley crew of kick-ass superheroines. After moving to a sleepy little town, young Lucky Prescott befriends a wild mustang named Spirit, who shares her rebellious spirit. When a heartless wrangler plans to capture Spirit and his herd, Lucky and her new friends embark on the adventure of a lifetime to rescue the horse that forever changed her life. Spirit Untamed is now showing at a cinema near you.   Global hysteria ensues after a mysterious catastrophe wipes out all electronics and takes away humanity’s ability to sleep in Netflix’s Awake. Scientists race against the clock to find a cure for the unexplained insomnia before its fatal effects eliminate the human race. When Jill, a former soldier, discovers her young daughter may be the key to salvation, she must decide whether to protect her children at all costs or sacrifice everything to save the world.   It’s open season on Harley Quinn when her explosive breakup with the Joker puts a big fat target on her back. Unprotected and on the run, Quinn faces the wrath of narcissistic crime boss Black Mask, his right-hand man, Victor Zsasz, and every other thug in the city. But things soon even out for Harley when she becomes unexpected allies with three deadly women — Huntress, Black Canary and Renee Montoya.
