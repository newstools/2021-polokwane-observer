Serves 8-10 You’ll need: 125g butter; 175g muscovado sugar; 100ml milk; 100g dried dates, pitted & chopped; 75g ginger preserve, chopped; 175g flour, sifted; ½ teaspoon bicarbonate of soda; ¼ teaspoon nutmeg; 2 eggs beaten; ¼ cup pecan nuts, chopped; 3 red dessert apples, cored and sliced (you could also use a mandolin); 2 tablespoons butter; 1 tablespoon sugar; 1 tablespoon Rum (optional). How to: Preheat the oven to 180 ˚C. Melt the butter, sugar, milk, ginger and dates and set aside for five minutes. Add the pecan nuts, bicarb, flour, nutmeg and eggs and combine. Pour into a 12-hole silicone muffin pan or divide among 11 oven-proof pudding bowls (just less than an ice cream scoop measurement) and bake for 18-20 minutes or until firm to the touch. Allow cooling before removing from muffin pan. If you have cooked the puddings in bowls, prick with a fork. Place the butter, sugar, Rum and apples in a pan, cover and cook on high for a few minutes until cooked but firm. Place the individual puddings from the muffin pan or bowls on a plate, pour over the sauce and top with apples. You could easily re-heat the individual puddings in the microwave (both with and without sauce). * Recipe by the Cook Studio.
