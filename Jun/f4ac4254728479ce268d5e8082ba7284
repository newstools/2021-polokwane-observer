The Bible League is an international Christian organisation that is focused on resourcing the poor or under resourced churches around the world and it aims to change society through biblically-based training and resources that meet the spiritual, moral, and social needs of their communities. “This programme is specifically for people who are not yet pastors and have not formed any churches. We, the organisation, prepare them spiritually for the task of being church planters,” explained Timothy Ramoshaba, the overseer of Limpopo Bible League International. The CPT consists of four modules and each module requires attendance three times a month. The recruitment for the training will start in July and Covid-19 regulations will be strictly adhered to. “We urge all who are interested to get in contact with us and those who qualify, will be informed of the venues and deadlines. Dr Thomas Resane, the National Director of Bible League International and I will inform those who are interested on the necessary procedures. Bear in mind that this programme is free of charge,” he said. Ramoshaba explained that church planters training is important to help establish churches that are based on God’s mandate for the church. “Churches have to help transform communities instead of being against them,” he added. Those who are interested can contact Timothy Ramoshaba on 068 057 1197 or e-mail BibleLeaguelimpopo@gmail.com. Their offices are at 82 Hans Van Rensburg, Rondebosch Office 4.
