It’s so exciting when your long-awaited puppy or kitty finally arrives, but the first few days in a new home is a huge adjustment for them and some adapt more easily than others. Here are a few useful tips: 1.Find out if you can visit your new puppy before he comes home with you so that you aren’t a complete stranger to him. Ask if you can take home a blanket or toy that he likes home with you. Check vaccinations are up to date if possible: some rescues have no medical history. * Source: rover.com
