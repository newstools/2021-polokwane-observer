Serves 4 – 6 You’ll need: 4 whole eggs, at room temperature; 125g butter, at room temperature (very important); 200g caster sugar; 75g self-raising flour; 75g desiccated coconut; 1 tsp. vanilla extract; 400ml full cream milk. To serve – 2 – 3 passion fruit, juice and pips; 150g castor sugar; Juice and zest of a lemon; 1 teaspoon cornflour. How to: Grease a 20cm pie dish that will fit in a roasting tin. Preheat the oven to 180°C. Prepare a water bath by filling a roasting tin with boiling water that will come halfway up the sides of the pie dish. Place the first six pudding ingredients in a food processor and whizz for two minutes until smooth and combined. Slowly pour the milk through the feeder tube with the motor running (do this slowly to avoid splattering) blend for a minute until combined and a smooth batter. Do not be concerned if the mixture looks a little curdled, it will come together when baked. Pour the coconut batter into the pie dish and place in the bain-marie. Bake for 35 – 40 minutes until the pudding is set. It will be golden on top with a luscious custard underneath. Serve with crème fraiche and the passionfruit sauce. To make the sauce heat the passion fruit juice and pips in a small saucepan with the sugar and lemon, mix the cornflour with a teaspoon of water and a tablespoon of the passionfruit syrup, make sure it is well blended and pour into the passionfruit syrup and stir over low – medium heat until thickened. Notes: To make the recipe on a Weber or a gas braai with a lid, place the roasting tin on the grid of the braai, close the lid and set the temperature to 180°C and bake for 35 – 45 minutes, checking after 35 minutes. * Recipe and image by The South African Poultry Association.
