Soap on a rope? Socks? Nah … What about a nice bottle of bourbon? This Father’s Day, toast dad in style with a Jim Beam Straight Kentucky Bourbon. It is the world’s number one selling bourbon, and with good reason. Created in 1788, Jacob Beam distilled excess corn from his father’s whisky recipe to produce a sweeter bourbon whisky. Aged for no less than two years, the bourbon contains 51 per cent corn and uses new charred oak barrels providing the vanilla and woody flavour to the drink. Cheers to dad with a Jim Beam Classic Highball: You’ll need: 50ml Jim Beam White; 120ml Soda Water; Lemon Wedge How to: Chill the glass, soda, and Jim Beam. Squeeze a wedge of lemon and place in glass. Fill glass with ice. Add 1 part Jim Beam. Pour soda gently filling the glass. Stir once and enjoy! Surviving for over 225 years, Jim Beam Straight Kentucky Bourbon is available at your nearest liquor store from R189. Details: jimbeam.com/en
