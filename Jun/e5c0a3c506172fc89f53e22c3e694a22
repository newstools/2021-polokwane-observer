A graduation ceremony was recently held in Polokwane where the students were awarded their qualifications as a token of their hard work. Clement Sithole, on behalf of the ETDP Seta congratulated students and reminded them that the learnership was about the skills they had gained and the impact this will have in the world of technology. He urged the students to use the qualification they obtained to explore opportunities. Maluta Mulibana from the Office of the Premier encouraged students to start their own businesses and in turn create opportunities for others. “Once you have acquired skills for yourself, it is not necessary to wait for a job opening or to apply for another learnership. You need to use this qualification to better your life. We have given you the opportunity to learn, now it is up to you to use the opportunity.” Mulibana says he is grateful to ATTI for availing themselves to take in the group of learners despite their disabilities. “You are a dedicated service provider and as much as we as provincial government want to assist, the actual work of equipping students lies with the service provider and you have done well.” Livhuwani Nageli, who spoke on behalf of the students, thanked the various stakeholders that were involved in the project and promised that his qualification will not go to waste. “Thank you for taking a chance on us and giving us the opportunity to be educated and gain skills that are vital in today’s world. We will not disappoint you.” Lesego Tshivhula, the Managing Director at ATTI, encouraged graduates to provide solutions for technological problems in the world. She congratulated each of them and thanked them for flying the ATTI flag high.
