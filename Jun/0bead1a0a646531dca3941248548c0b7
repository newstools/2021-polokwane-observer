The American Bee’s Knees cocktail has honey and refreshing citrus notes to complement the juniper botanicals of many gins. To prepare, simply mix 44mls American gin, 5mls freshly squeezed lemon juice and 25 mls honey. Shake well with ice, pour into a cocktail glass and garnish with a thin slice of fresh lemon peel. Ring the changes … orange and naartjie season is here. Try a classic Bee’s Knees with naartjie or orange juice instead of lemon juice, and garnish with fynbos or spekboom for a distinctly South African cocktail.
