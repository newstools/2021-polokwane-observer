South Africa’s leading property website, Private Property has purchased a home and partnered with Builders to renovate it. The fixer-upper apartment, located in Blackheath, Johannesburg was snapped up for R860 000 (from the Private Property website, of course) and boasts 2 bedrooms, an open-plan lounge and dining area, and a spacious garden – appealing to both small families and young professionals who might need extra space to work or study now that remote working has become more prevalent. The exciting partnership will see Private Property and Builders work together to renovate the home, using nothing but the building materials, tools, décor and accessories available at Builders. The best part is, we’ll bring you along for the journey, showcasing every step of the process in our ‘Ready to Renovate’ series, so that you can gain handy tips and tricks to help you tackle your own home renovation projects with confidence. “Whether you’re a first-time buyer, homeowner or seasoned investor, the Ready to Renovate series will provide all the information, tools and inspiration you need to transform your home or rental property into a space that’s not only functional and comfortable, but also a worthwhile investment,” explains Tracey Lee Miller, Brand and Marketing Executive at Private Property.
