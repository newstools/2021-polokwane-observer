The newly selected team hopes to do better than the 2019 team that finished third. Boshomane said they believe they have players with multi-functional qualities in the squad who are ready to fulfill their objectives. “We aim for gold and we will get it. Some of the prolific players in the squad are Space Matsimela, Thandi Malebana, Pertunia Kgolane and Makgoroane Molomo. These are top players and they have been performing well in their respective teams. They have national and international experience and we are confident that they will help us to win the title.” The Softball Premier League was launched in April 2019 by the Department of Sport and Recreation. The league gives 16 teams, men and women, from nine provinces an opportunity to compete in the league over a four-week period.
