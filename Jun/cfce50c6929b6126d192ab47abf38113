Ramathuba says Senior Cardiologist, Dr Anthony Becker will be assisting the province to perform a number of complicated cardiology cases which cannot be performed in the province. “We are excited to welcome the respected cardiologist to our institution. Dr Becker will assist to give the people of Limpopo a better chance at medical services.” Ramathuba was there to witness the cardiology team performing a complex coronary intervention and the team would have operated on seven patients including five with chronic total occlusion on the same day. Thabisha Komape is one of the two cardiologist at the institution. The department appointed her as an internal medicine specialist in 2015 but only started in 2020 as a cardiologist. Ramathuba says the visit by Becker will assist Komape to gain some expertise and tips from the senior doctor. “We have agreed that she needs to be empowered with relevant equipment and skills that will enable her to do her work better. Some of the equipment includes a rotablator, which have since been procured by the department to assist with cardiology procedures. Our cathlab which is used jointly with the cardiothoracic unit is fully functional.” According to the department, Becker comes at no extra cost to the province, and as a mentor he will transfer his skills to Komape and the entire team which in turn will benefit the people of Limpopo. “There are no words to express our appreciation to Becker,” Ramathuba said. Eight patients who have been waiting for their procedures to be done in Gauteng will be the first to benefit from this programme.
