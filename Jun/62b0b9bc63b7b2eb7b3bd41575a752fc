Lambert and Blakemore, who represented the province, played good shots and strokes against past and present Protea players. Blakemore said even though they did not win any trophies or medals they value the experience. “We competed against 20 teams from various provinces. It was not an easy battle but we carried ourselves well throughout the days.” Blakemore congratulated the Port Natal team who won the tournament after they thrashed Northern Cape mixed pairs team in the finals. “They did well and we learned a lot from them,” he said.
