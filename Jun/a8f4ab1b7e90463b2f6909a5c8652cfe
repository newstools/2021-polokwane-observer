The 30-year-old private chef operates from Thornhill and his love for food has led him towards a career in the culinary industry. He shared that growing up, he never envisioned himself a chef but when selecting a course after matric, nothing tickled his fancy until somebody suggested that he challenge himself and study hospitality. “I studied at the Capricorn College for TVET and I have not looked back since,” he said. Chef Kim has been in the industry for four years and is working on building a widely recognised brand and getting regular clients. “It is not easy but having a brand is very important because people are clear on the type of people they want to work with. My food has to meet certain standards and that is what I am constantly working on. I want to be known as that great chef whose food you can never have just once,” he said. He added that the competition in the industry is high hence it is important to stand out and bring something different to the table. He explained that for him, this means putting your heart into every dish as you only get one chance to impress a client for them to trust you enough to acquire your services again. “I enjoy making juicy meals, meals that are filling and allow you to feast with your eyes before you taste,” he added. As a private chef, his speciality is making dishes that meet the clients standards and sometimes this requires him to draw inspiration from whatever he finds in the kitchen. He plans to also go into the space of cooking at private schools and private hospitals, as well as opening an exclusive restaurant. “In the near future, I plan to host cookout events. Whichever path the road leads to first, I promise you that my food will always leave you wanting more. That is a guarantee,” he added.
