“Customer satisfaction is part of everything we do at Ford, and providing the right parts at the right time and price is a crucial link that enables Ford to strengthen its commitment to the customer,” said John Segaar, customer service division director at Ford South Africa. Trained technicians will first conduct a professional assessment before fitting an original equipment (OE) approved part, whether that be a battery, brake pads or tyres. “Not many customers are aware that fitting a correct OE battery can also improve fuel efficiency, as an incorrect or poor-performing battery can lead to inefficiencies of fuel injectors and other components,” Segaar said. Brakes and tyres are high-performing parts that are exposed to severe wear and tear. They are also critical elements in terms of safety. “It is therefore exceptionally important that customers have their vehicle’s battery, tyres and brakes checked, and are aware of the difference that genuine Ford parts can make,” said Ford.
