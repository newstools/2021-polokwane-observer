“The previous GSX-S1000 A and F model did quite well on the South African market. Customers just loved the power, smoothness and reliability. Laddering up to that, the NEW Suzuki GSX-S1000 now comes with an all-new electronics package and aggressive new styling.” Some of the new technologies include a bi-directional quick shift system, a five-mode traction control system and drive mode selector. “Every aspect of performance has been refined,” said Suzuki. “Overall power output is increased and is stronger through the low- to mid-range engine speeds most commonly used in daily riding. The revised exhaust and intake cam profiles decrease the amount of lift and reduce valve lift overlap to achieve a better overall balance of performance and controllability across a broad range of engine speeds, while also contributing to improved emissions performance.” Pricing and launch details to be released in due time.
