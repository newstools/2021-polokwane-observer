Adams formed the club in 2018 with the aim of growing the sport in the area and giving aspiring female rugby players an opportunity to showcase their talent. The 31-year-old full back for Noordelikes Rugby Club says he is happy with the strides they have made over the past three years. “We started with only two female rugby players and we currently boast 15. The aim is to have more female players in the club so that we are able to compete.” He also thanked the Westenburg community, teachers and parents for allowing their children to be part of the club. “It was difficult to rope in the girls because of the stigma associated with the sporting code. I had to dig deep and make a endearing presentation to the community members and teachers in the surrounding schools to convince their girls to join the club.” He further stated the selection of their players, Dineo Semono and Anneline Williams into the Limpopo Blou Bulls female rugby team is a clear indication that they are doing something right. “I think we are on the right track. We need a helping hand here and there. We need resources and financial support to motivate the players. That forms part of our goal which is to produce good players and ambassadors for the club. We just need more resources and financial support so that we are able to produce more players,” concluded Adams.
