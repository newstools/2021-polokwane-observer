On Father’s Day this month, three generations of the Pentz family, Peter Pentz senior (The Old Man), his son Nick and grandson Peter will be celebrating their rich heritage together. Peter Junior, who recently joined the farm after completing his studies, says they’re celebrating the generations who paved the way before them, with a family lunch complemented by Groote Post’s popular range of The Old Man’s Blend wines. So why don’t you follow suit and spoil your Old Man with a bottle of The Old Man’s Blend wines, a range of Serious Wines, a Red and a White, at Seriously Good Prices!  Groote Post’s The Old Man’s Blend White 2020 This wine is a blend of 50 per cent Sauvignon Blanc and 50 per cent Chenin Blanc. The varietals are vinified separately, then blended in different ratios until the blend meets The Old Man’s approval. With enticing aromas of guava and pear and gorgeous tropical fruit flavours, you’ll taste refreshing citrus flavours. Winemaker, Lukas Wentzel, proudly states that “this wine is sure to be a terrific value-for-money crowd pleaser”. Around R88.  Groote Post’s The Old Man’s Blend Red 2019 This wine is a blend of 50 per cent Merlot, 25 per cent Cabernet Sauvignon and 25 per cent Shiraz. “This is a fantastic vintage. The three varietals all reached optimal ripeness in perfect timing for the harvest”, says Lukas. This is a down-to-earth, ripe-fruit-driven blend. Captivating red fruit notes delight the senses, most notably cherry, raspberry and cranberry, with soft tannins giving a smooth finish. Around R93.   Groote Post’s The Old Man’s Blend wines are available from groote-post-wines.myshopify.com/collections/all and nationally at leading wine retailers and select restaurants.
