While most couples sign a prenuptial agreement before getting married, there’s no mention of a written agreement or a baby prenup before becoming parents. But why is that? Aside from getting married, moving to a new house, or starting a new job (all of which necessitate written contracts), having a child is one of the most life-changing experiences anyone can have. New parents, on the other hand, often go in blind and don’t discuss expectations ahead of time. This can lead to a slew of issues, as one or both parents expect the other to act a certain way or do certain things, such as get up for night feeds, assist with cooking, or go grocery shopping. If these expectations aren’t met, it can lead to feelings of resentment and hostility between parents, which can snowball into anxiety and postpartum depression. While it might sound intimidating, a baby prenup is simply a written agreement between an expecting couple that lays out childcare expectations for both parents before your baby is born. According to the US-based Pew Research Center, which analyses social and demographic trends, the way mothers and fathers spend their time has changed dramatically in the past half-century. Dads are doing more housework and childcare and moms more paid work outside the home. Neither has overtaken the other in their ‘traditional’ realms, but their roles are converging. Interestingly, researchers also reported that 56% of working moms and 50% of working dads say they find it very, or somewhat difficult to balance these responsibilities. This means that in the age of modern parenting, which includes many demands, it’s more important than ever for new parents to have a written baby prenup to help them navigate their way through this tricky transition.
