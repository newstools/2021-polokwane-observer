The foundation was founded in February by Ngwato Aubrey Phasha from Flora Park. The 27-year-old holds a B-tech honours in public management, national diploma in policing and is currently a third-year law student at the University of South Africa. “I also work as a lecturer and head of department at Brooklyn City College. I strongly believe in taking every opportunity that presents itself, if it is going to better you or your life,” he said. Phasha explained that the foundation was founded on the principle of one day having communities that are self-sustaining and economically independent. “This will in turn improve the state of the natural environment, we would also like to one day be able to offer medical aid, legal aid and assistance to the elderly and to take measures to ensure their social well-being,” he said. He added that the strategy they use to help the people, exists on four elements which are identify, plan, produce and reinvest. “We do a background check on the families we want to assist to confirm that they do indeed need assistance. Thereafter, we plan on the best course of action for the said family and then produce whatever the foundation can offer. We create a relationship with our donors and the donations are not once-off,” he added. Phasha added that although it is a calling for him to help the less fortunate, it gets challenging because money is not always readily available to do all the things that they would like to. “Some of the donations come from our own pockets because we do not expect to gain anything from this. We would, however, appreciate all the help that we can get and we would like to emphasise that we are not asking for monetary donations. Money is the last thing we need, we would appreciate the help to come in the form of the things we need at the time, be it food parcels, sanitary pads and so forth,” he explained.
