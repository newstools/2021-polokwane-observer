The online system was recently announced by the department, and Spokesperson Tidimalo Chuene says the system aims to have all learners placed by the end of the admission process. The system will be able to provide accurate data for subsequent activities and planning, and an auditable trace of all factors affecting admission decisions. This comes after admission and placement of learners had been a headache over the past few years with quite a number of parents protesting outside the provincial department’s offices due to a lack of admission space at their preferred schools, despite applying on time. Some of the parents raised questions on the system used to admit learners. Tidimalo says the department is thrilled to provide a solution that offers convenience to parents and guardians, who will now be able to make applications for admission remotely and not have to take time off from their responsibilities to queue at schools. Those that wish to submit their applications physically will still be able to do so. The following services will now be available online: • Filling in of online admission forms. • Uploading the required documentation according to policies. • Choosing the preferred schools for children, in order of preference. • Receiving feedback on the outcomes of the application. • Appealing unwanted outcomes of the application with justification.
