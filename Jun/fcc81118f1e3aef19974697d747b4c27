As the days grow shorter and it gets darker earlier, you need to take a few extra precautions to ensure your safety when you’re exercising outdoors. We chatted to Charnel Hattingh from Fidelity ADT, who says not only do people exercising outdoors have to be aware of other road users, but they must be mindful of criminals too, who added that there are cases muggings of joggers and cyclists and bicycles and other valuables being stolen at gunpoint, and while these types of incidents often take place in broad daylight on busy roads, it is concerning how many people still exercise alone in isolated areas. While it’s important to keep a routine and to stay  motivated in your fitness regime, this shouldn’t be done to your detriment. Criminals definitely take advantage of the longer cover of darkness in winter. So it’s really not advisable to be out in the dark. Besides muggings, there are other types of emergencies, too … falling and not being seen, getting injured or being hit by a car. So before you tie up your trainer laces, take heed of these top 10 tips for winter outdoor safety when exercising: Charnel says the most critical of the tips offered is avoiding isolated areas, exercising alone and heading off or coming back in the dark. More clever advice: Take heed of crime trends in your area which are shared on WhatsApp groups and always report any incidents or suspicious persons to the police or your security company.
