Besides its elegant soft outer edges and glossy finish, and the fact that it’s available in both LTE and 5G models, it’s the Samsung Galaxy A32’s iconic camera design that captured our hearts (see what we did there!). Be it a looking-hot selfie for Instagram, a pic of your new baby Golden Retriever pup, a landscape image as you drive through the Karoo … every  breathtaking moment comes out perfectly with the multi-lens camera. The main camera lens is 48MP in the 5G and 64MP in the LTE, perfect for ultra-high res, crisp and clear images. This device also has a depth camera, an ultra-wide camera with a 123-degree angle of view, and a macro camera when you need to get in close. Even your selfies will be a clear delight with the 20MP front camera. And forget about not being able to catch the perfect shot because of low battery. Nope … the impressive 2-day 1 battery gives you more time to do what you love — streaming, sharing and snapping away. All this while you feast your eyes on the cinematic viewing with the LTE’s 6.4-inch FHD+ sAMOLED display and the 6.5-inch HD+ TFT screen on the 5G version. With more people expressing themselves through video, the Galaxy A32 does not disappoint. Enjoy 4K UHD video recording, which lets you grab still photos with a tap of a button. Then there is the Pro Video Mode to create your best stories yet. Now for some specs. Galaxy A32 delivers a big boost in performance thanks to an advanced Octa-core processor and up to 4GB of RAM. You can store more and delete less with 128GB internal storage. This really is a smartphone fit for someone ready to create, communicate, and express themselves in their best life. You can choose between Awesome Black, Awesome Blue or Awesome Violet. Whichever shade you prefer … trust us … this Samsung’s awesome!
