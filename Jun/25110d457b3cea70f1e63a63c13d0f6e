In anticipation of the car’s local launch, Toyota South Africa and Toyota Gazoo Racing South Africa (TGRSA) have partnered up to provide enthusiasts a sneak peek of the newcomer’s dynamic abilities. The FIVEDRIVES campaign combines five iconic locations across South Africa with Five TGRSA ambassadors – putting the GR Yaris through its paces, while giving the motoring public their “off-the-cuff” feedback on the vehicle. Part 1: Aldo Scribante and Michael van Rooyen The iconic Aldo Scribante Raceway located in Gqeberha (Port Elizabeth), played backdrop to the first instalment of the FIVEDRIVES campaign. With multiple high-speed sweeps, off-camber kinks and a fast, flowing design, Aldo Scribante is an excellent test of a vehicle’s chassis, transitional behaviour and “off-corner” grip.  Michael van Rooyen is no stranger to speed, usually found behind the wheel of the TGRSA Corolla Global Touring Car (GTC), high-speed grip-driving is the “Rustenburg Rocket’s” speciality. Watch the video for Van Rooyen’s take on the GR Yaris as we pit it against the championship-leading TGRSA GTC Corolla. Look out for Part 2; featuring the GR Yaris, in the hands of another renowned TGRSA ambassador and a different iconic location. #GRYARIS Source: MotorPress
