These finalists do not just qualify for the car of the year title, they can also win top honours in the different categories in which they are competing.  Category winners and the overall SA Car of the Year winner will be announced on June 26. What are your thoughts? Leave a comment below. The SAGMJ has also created a separate platform where the public can vote for both overall as well as their category favourite. The winner here will be awarded the Motoring Enthusiast’s Choice Trophy. A few lucky voters can also walk away with an Advanced/Defensive Driver Training as well as 4×4 Off-Road Driver Training course.
