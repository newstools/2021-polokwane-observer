The announcement followed the reported outbreak of the disease in various parts of KwaZulu-Natal on Sunday. The Spokesperson for the Department, Joshua Kwapa said sporadic outbreaks continue to be problematic. “We currently do not have any reported incidents in the province, however, we have made concerted efforts from relevant government departments and entities, in terms of the maintenance of the Kruger National Park fences, improved management of border fences with their neighboring countries and timeous availability of vaccines.” He added that as part of overall animal disease control, 4 500 dipping sessions would be conducted for communal cattle. “Veterinary services have been allocated R52,9 million to render veterinary services. To reduce the level of risks associated with meat handling for public consumption, 480 inspections would be conducted at facilities that are producing meat and meat products. These facilities include abattoirs and meat processors,” remarked Kwapa. He further stated that they will engage Provincial Treasury on requisite funding that will enable them to implement the planned intervention measures that are of provincial responsibility. “For 2021/22 financial year, with the budget allocated, we have planned to conduct 148 FMD vaccination sessions,” concluded Kwapa. Foot and mouth disease is a severe, highly contagious viral disease of livestock that has a significant economic impact. The disease affects cattle, swine, sheep, goats and other cloven-hoofed ruminants. Intensively reared animals are more susceptible to the disease than traditional breeds. The disease is rarely fatal in adult animals, but there is often high mortality in young animals due to myocarditis or, when the dam is infected by the disease, lack of milk.
