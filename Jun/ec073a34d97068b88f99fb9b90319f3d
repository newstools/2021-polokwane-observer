Playing host to two rounds of the global WRX-series, the Killarney WRX course combines tight tarmac sections, gravel s’s, jumps and, of course, the infamous “Joker”. Giniel de Villiers is considered one of the most versatile and accomplished motorsport heroes in South Africa. His repertoire includes production car racing, touring cars, cross-country championships, multiple Dakar podiums as well as local rallying. With Table Mountain in the background, it seemed a fitting arena to let De Villiers loose and sample the all-new Toyota GR Yaris. Here, the car’s three-mode driver-selectable AWD system would be put to the test, while the quick steering rack, weight distribution and punchy power delivery would be placed under close scrutiny. Watch the video to see how things went down and hear De Villier’s thoughts on the latest Gazoo Racing product. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLseOIV3pMEg9QLMmlUFNZwoCOxXm82Cg1 Source: MotorPress
