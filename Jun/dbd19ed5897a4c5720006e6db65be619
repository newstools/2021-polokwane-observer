“The all-new Infiniti QX60 exemplifies our new expression of modern Japanese luxury. It’s powerful, intuitive and serene – exactly what our customers want from our premium, three-row SUV,” said Infiniti’s chairperson. “At its heart is a powerful V6 engine, all-new nine-speed automatic transmission, available Intelligent All-Wheel Drive, and enhanced ProPILOT Assist with Navi Link to help the 2022 Infiniti QX60 deliver comfort, refinement and confidence to its driver and passengers,” said Nissan.  Among the features you will find in the interior are a high-definition touchscreen, wireless charging and Wi-Fi connectivity. More information will be released closer to launch dates in 2022.
