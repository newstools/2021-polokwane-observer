After the creation of the Manhattan cocktail, and possibly before the devising of the Martini, came the Martinez. It’s a bridge between two iconic cocktails and perfect if you’re not sure which mixology direction to take.  Give it a try and let us know what you think! To create a Martinez you will need: 30ml American Gin, 10ml Sweet Vermouth, 2 dashes Orange Bitters, 1 bar spoon Maraschino liqueur, lemon zest (for garnish). Chill a Martini Glass/Coupe, either by putting ice into the glass or leaving it in a fridge/freezer. Pour all the ingredients into a stirring glass and stir about 20 times. The more you stir, the more the ice will melt into the drink and dilute it. Remove the ice from the serving glass and strain the drink. Garnish with lemon zest and … cheers. You’ve now mastered one of the classic cocktails from The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS), as part of the “Cheers! Spirits from the U.S.A” campaign, currently running in South Africa.
