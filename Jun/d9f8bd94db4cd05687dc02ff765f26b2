An eyewitness, Ndivhuwo Chirenga, who was on the scene says she noticed a large group of people gathering at the skip bin and decided to find out what the fuss was about. She says it was at about 17:30 on Friday, 18 June when she was walking home from work when she noticed the gathering. “The first thing I saw was the body of the fetus. As a mother I was deeply saddened at the sight, considering how much of a blessing it is to have a child.” Chirenga says when she got there the fetus had just been discovered by one of the nyaope boys roaming around town, who had been going through the skip bin looking for food. Mojapelo was unable to provide more information regarding the incident by the time of going to print.
