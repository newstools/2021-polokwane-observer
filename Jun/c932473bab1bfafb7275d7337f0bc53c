Children have beautifully delicate skin that requires gentle skincare products. While numerous soaps, creams, lotions, and other skin-care products on store shelves, it is important to avoid items containing chemicals like sulfates and parabens. Finding a brand that targets sensitive skin is best for children. Here are a few tips on how to keep your child’s skin healthy: Although children love playing in the bath and splashing about – limit the time they spend in the bath. This can prevent their skin from drying out. Make every second or third day “fun” bath time, and the others can be short washes. After bath time, keep your little one’s skin well moisturised. Use a child-friendly lotion after every wash. This will give your little one’s skin all it needs to stay moisturised throughout the day. Vaseline is an excellent product that does not cause irritation but will prevent dry skin conditions. Use a gentle fabric conditioner to wash your little one’s clothes. This will ensure that your child’s clothes are soft and won’t cause any skin irritations. The weather outside dictates how your child should be dressed to keep her comfortable and to protect her skin, but no matter if it’s hot or cold, your child needs to be protected from the sun. Your child’s skin is too sensitive to be exposed to harsh UV rays, so ensure she’s kept covered. Always use sunscreen when venturing outdoors with your child. Avoid dressing your child in tight-fitted clothing or items with scratchy materials such as lace or even certain types of wool and cashmere. Soft cottons are ideal for youngsters. During the teen years, acne becomes common. Learning how to keep skin clean and choosing the right products will keep breakouts to a minimum. When pimples form, it is crucial to never pop them. Bacteria may spread, or scarring may result. If acne is severe, products that contain benzoyl peroxide may help.
