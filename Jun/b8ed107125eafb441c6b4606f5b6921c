The CEO of MasterDrive, Eugene Herbert, extracted some interesting statistics from these surveys: • While three out of four companies have a distracted while driving (DWD) policy in place, only 18% of companies require employees to set their phone to “do not disturb” before setting off. • While 74% of surveyed executives consider distracted driving to be a grave concern, another 12% do not worry about the liability associated with a DWD crash. • 10% of consumers admit to talking on the phone while driving. • 30% of drivers admit to being in a near-miss collision because they were distracted. “If, according to the surveys, 87% of executives expect employees to sometime or frequently be reachable when outside the office, it is not surprising that 20% of consumers reply to work-related messages while driving, 50% say they need to always be available and 17% consider driving time an ideal time to get more work done. A realistic solution to this is not a simple one. If anything can wait until the driver reaches their destination, pressure should be placed on executives to emphasise this in their communication. If it cannot wait, however, DWD policies should take cognisance of this and outline how to handle it.” “There are various options available,” said Herbert. “The one is to rather call if the employee has Bluetooth enabled, as opposed to sending messages or emails. Another is to make use of new technology that allows employees to be made aware of urgent communication without touching a phone. These apps can also block non-essential applications which effectively removes the decision from the hands of employees who may not take DWD policies seriously. “It should also encourage companies to assess the demands placed on employees, particularly when they are driving, and how to change behaviour to ensure DWD policies are enforced and drivers have a safe working environment,” concluded Herbert.
