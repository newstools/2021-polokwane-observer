Kick off your week with the fourth and final season of a superhero series which is based on a DC Comics character; binge a horror anthology series where each episode revolves around a holiday, including Halloween, Christmas and Valentine’s Day; and get ready for the last outrageous season with the Gallaghers, one of television’s most irreverent families. Jefferson Pierce is a man with many faces. He is a former Olympic athlete, respected educator and a father of two. He is also Black Lightning, a superpowered protector of the fictional city of Freeland with the ability to sense and harness electricity. In Black Lightning S4 Jefferson vows to leave his hero days behind. But new threats to Freeland — and metas — draw all the Pierces back into the fray. Starts June 29 on Netflix.   Into the Dark is an anthology series that tells a frightening horror story for the duration of a feature film. These stories all have a common theme … they all take place during what should be a lovely holiday. Binge season one and two now on Showmax.   It’s the last call for The Gallaghers and you’re invited to the party to end all parties. After a decade of dysfunction, the South Side’s favourite clan is going out with the biggest bang ever. It’s going to be a wild last ride, but changes are coming that will force each of them to either step up or hit the road. And while devolving may come more naturally than evolving in a family where excess never gets old, they know one thing for certain – Gallaghers may grow up, but they’ll never grow apart. Shameless S11 starts June 29 on M-Net.
