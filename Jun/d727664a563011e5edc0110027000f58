The Chairperson of the association, Charles Seabi says while some members of the association were waiting for the police to arrive to hand over the suspected criminal, a crowd of roughly 30 people gathered and started assaulting the man. According to Seabi, the suspect was released from jail last Thursday. He went on a crime spree in Mankweng over the weekend where he terrorised the community in Ga-Mothiba. “One of the people he stole from is a driver affiliated with the association, who took it upon himself to track him down and they found him at his home in Ga-Mothiba. “Unfortunately they felt that the police in Mankweng would not act swiftly, and they opted to bring him to town in order to hand him over to the Polokwane police.” While they were waiting for the police, community members learned of these events, and demanded that they get a hand on him as they had struggled with him countless times in the past. Seabi said what happened next was beyond the control of the association. “There were around eight of us and we couldn’t fight against a mob of 30 people. When these people came here they just took over and demanded to take him from us, saying they had no faith in the police.” The man was eventually taken to hospital. According to Seabi, the crowd wanted to bring across the message to would-be criminals, that “they will be dealt with”. Police Spokesperson, Brigr Motlafela Mojapelo confirmed the incident but says no case was opened at the Polokwane Police Station.
