Take time to choose your clothes and accessories if you’re building your wardrobe. You don’t have to buy the first thing you see, rip the tags off and wear it right away. Make sure your clothes are steamed or pressed; this adds instant polish to even your most worn-in clothes. Always travel with a mini steamer. Gilded touches, whether a bag or jewellery, add a pop of glamour to any outfit. Big sunglasses add glamour every time. A monochrome outfit, like black and white, always looks intentional and put together; just make sure your whites are bright and your blacks match. Tuck in your shirt or cinch your waist with a belt if you need a quick smarten up. Look after your handbags and pack them in dust bags when travelling. A tailored jacket is your best friend as it elevates everything from denim to dresses and takes you effortlessly from day to night. Add heels and keep your silhouettes and washes classic. Forget the trends and focus on coats that are forever: a classic camel, a navy pea, black leather, belted trench and denim. Match your shoes and your bag When in doubt, keep your accessories in the same colour palette; your look will come off as intentional, not haphazard. Prints are the easiest way to make an outfit look tired; stick to solids and add a dose of spots here and there. Healthy blow-dried hair, red lips and flawless skin are the ultimate finishing touches. * Source: Adapted from harpersbazaar.com
