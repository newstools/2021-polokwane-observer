Plan your next winter weekend getaway at Zuurberg Mountain Village, the 160-year-old haven situated high up on the Zuurberg Pass in the Eastern Cape and is only an hour from the airport in PE aka Gqeberha. Wake up overlooking misty hills, explore hiking trails or go on a game drive in Addo Elephant Park. Tuck into the country fare, good wines and warm nightcaps around the crackling fire before retreating to your cosy cottage. Don’t forget to book a well-deserved spa treatment too. The Zuurberg Mountain Village winter special is valid until September 30, 2021, and includes dinner, bed and breakfast. Terms and conditions apply.
