This weekend, we’re all about having a good laugh. Start with an action-comedy about the world’s most lethal odd couple – a bodyguard and a hitman who are back on another life-threatening mission; watch a heart-warming, funny and emotional true story about a widower taking on one of the toughest jobs in the world… fatherhood; and lastly, chuckle your way through a comedy-drama about a superstar singer and her overworked personal assistant who are given a choice that could alter the course of their respective careers. The sequel to 2017’s The Hitman’s Bodyguard. Three years after the events of the original film, bodyguard Michael Bryce continues his friendship with assassin Darius Kincaid as they embark on a new adventure to save Sonia, Darius’s wife, from new threats. The Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard is now showing at a cinema near you.   A man’s wife passes away the day after giving birth to their first daughter, and they must rebuild the life that follows in Fatherhood. The drama is actually based on a bestselling book titled Two Kisses For Maddy: A Memoir of Loss and Love by Matthew Logelin. Heartbreakingly enough, the plot is based on a true story that happened to the author himself. Watch it on Netflix this weekend.   Set in the dazzling world of the LA music scene comes the story of Grace Davis, a superstar whose talent, and ego, have reached unbelievable heights. Maggie is Grace’s overworked personal assistant who’s stuck running errands but still aspires to her childhood dream of becoming a music producer. When Grace’s manager presents her with a choice that could alter the course of her career, Maggie and Grace come up with a plan that could change their lives forever.
