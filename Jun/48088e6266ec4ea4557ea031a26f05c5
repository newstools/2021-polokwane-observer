On the 1st of July 2021 the Protection Of Personal Information (POPI) Act 4 of 2013 will be in full affect. If you are a business owner you probably know by now that there are certain measures that need to be set in place to be fully POPI compliant. First Technology can help with that. POPICheck is an evaluation service that can help you determine exactly how POPI compliant you are and what you need to do to improve your compliance status. Your compliance status will be determined through the evaluation of the following four main categories: Policy & Strategy, Lifecycle & Process, Security and People.  Using this system, POPICheck will identify the area(s) where you are the least POPI compliant, as well as prioritise the actions you need to take to rectify these shortcomings. Once complete, you will also receive accredited proof that you are POPI compliant, reassuring clients and business partners that they are in safe hands. You can continuously use this platform, logging your progress from your initial evaluation until fully compliant. POPICheck is extremely easy to understand, use and access. You can keep track of what still needs to be done and what you don’t need to worry about.  Don’t let POPI keep you rolling around in bed at night.
