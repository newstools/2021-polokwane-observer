Storage is essential in a bathroom for all the lotions, beauty products, soaps and shampoos you may have. For example, identify what you need in the shower and then get the right storage for them so you avoid annoying bottles falling all over the place. Use a linen cupboard to store your towels, baskets for loo paper and vanity drawers and cupboards for products to be out of sight. Plants work so well in bathroom spaces and the naturally occurring ambient humidity from the steam of a shower is perfect for a wide array of tropical and sub-tropical plants like orchids, peace lilies, ferns and even air plants. They add a wonderful connection to nature, soften materials like marble or tile and add a gentle aspect of colour. Soft matting underfoot protects feet from cold tiles and adds a touch of luxury. Every bathroom needs a bathmat but depending on the size of the bathroom, don’t be afraid to use more than one or explore different shapes like a round carpet in the middle of a bathroom. Simple elements like small decorative shelves for face cloths, candles diffusers and plants can make the world of difference. Decanting oils and salts into pretty bottles adds a spa-like quality that’s functional and aesthetically pleasing. Bathroom tiles create pattern play and subtle interest. Tiles are also a great way to create a feature area or wall with a smaller budget because you can combine cost-effective and expensive tiles to give a sense of elegance without the expense. Having a built-in shower seat, an ottoman or even a little bench to rest a towel on is always a nice touch and adds an element of luxury to a bathroom even in a much smaller space. * Source: Supplied on behalf of interior designer Kim Williams.
