After a course of some 12 weeks on the Nissan Navara, they will spearhead the launch of a Nissan assembly plant in Ghana. With their newly acquired knowledge and skills, they will ensure that the assembly in Ghana will be equal to that of Nissan’s global production standard. “The production of a vehicle is intricate, so the training course we have been offering will not be the end of our work to support the Ghanaian team’s capabilities,” said Shafick Solomons, plant director. “This is a wonderful moment for us as a global company with incredible African roots,” said Mike Whitfield, managing director of Nissan. “Now we are laying the groundwork to do just that in Ghana, as we help the people and government of Ghana begin to realise their dream of creating a sustainable automotive industry in their country.” The Navara production facility is located in Accra, the capital of Ghana. “Nissan and Japan Motors support the Ghana Automotive Development Policy, which is why we want to do our part to create jobs and stimulate African economies. We both want to create a new future for the sector and change the lives of the people who build, test and drive these vehicles,” said Salem Kalmoni, managing director, Japan Motors. Source: MotorPress
