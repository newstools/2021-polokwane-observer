If you’re a parent you’ll understand just how important choosing the right pram is for both baby and you! Here’s how to pick a pram that meets both of your requirements… Despite what some may believe, prams and strollers are not the same things. Prams are made specifically for newborns; they’re sturdy, don’t collapse, and allow the baby to travel while lying down. Strollers, on the other hand, are ideal for older babies who want to see the world from an upright sitting position. They’re usually small and fold up to fit in the boot of your car. Many mothers prefer travel systems that include a car seat that snaps into place inside the pram. These are ideal for younger babies because they can be transferred from the car to the pram without being awakened. Remove the car seat from its base, place it in the pram, and you’re ready to go. Are you planning to take your baby for walks around the neighborhood, or will you be using your pram to carry your child around shopping malls? It’s critical to think about things like the surfaces the pram will travel on, such as whether they’ll be smooth or bumpy. Are you going to walk on the sidewalks or in parks? Although folding a pram appears to be a simple task, most have push/pull levers and switches that can be difficult for a tired brain to understand. Try out the pram before purchasing it. Is it cumbersome? Is it easy to get it into your car? Are you able to put it together quickly? A good pram will last not only for your baby’s first few years but also for your subsequent children. Find out if there’s a guarantee and what it covers, as well as any extras that will make your trip more enjoyable. Consider extra pockets for blankies, tissues, wipes, or keys, as well as a cupholder (you’ll need somewhere to put your cappuccino, after all!) and shopping bag storage under the seat.
