Deliveries of the first Giulia GTA and GTAm On June 24, early bird purchasers of the exclusive Giulia GTA and GTAm collected the first of these extraordinary cars. Only 500 numbered units will be produced. For these lucky few, an exclusive customer experience was prepared, as part of a dedicated journey that binds together tradition and innovation.  They had the opportunity to chat to the heads of the brand and of design and engineering, who took them through the exclusive experience, telling them about its details and the background of a unique project. Customers discovered the DNA of these cars as they moved through the Museum focusing on the quest for lightness, developed over the decades to improve performance on the track and driving pleasure on the road. Most importantly, they sat in the driver’s seat of their new Giulia and took part in an exclusive parade on the Museum’s indoor track. It was a remarkable opportunity to drive this supercar.  Fitted with a supercharged variant of the 403kW 2.9 V6 Bi-Turbo engine, with a best-in-class power-to-weight ratio of 140kW per litre, it epitomises the brand’s unique capability to combine style and sportiness. However, the remarkable performance of the Giulia is based not only on its high-performance engine, but also on the extensive use of ultralight materials. The Giulia GTA has thus been able to achieve a weight up to 100kg lower than that of the Quadrifoglio version on which it is based. With the support of the Centro Stile, a logo has been created that pays tribute to the brand’s 111-year history. Source: QuickPic
