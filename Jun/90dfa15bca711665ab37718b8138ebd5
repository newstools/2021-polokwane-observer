The 20-year-old who goes by the stage name ‘Keen’ from Westenburg is a versatile artist who enjoys making hip-hop, RnB and dance hall music. “I have always been interested in music and constantly followed music trends. I want to know what is relevant and capitalise on that,” he explained. Keen got in studio and recorded his first song ‘Lit Lit’ at the age of 17. It was a resounding success which made him want to get back into studio to record more songs. He is signed with Planet 6ix Records which has helped him grow as an artist. “I am surrounded by talent and that alone inspires me to do better and be better,” he added. Keen shared that he spends a lot of time on YouTube where he keeps a tab on current music and learns as much as he can on how the music business works, and how to build his brand to stand out. He has a song ‘Ontym Overtym’ which plays on music channels such as Channel O and Trace. He has another music video coming out for his song titled ‘Since’. He will release an Extended Play Record (EP) later in the year and is currently working on features with artists from the United States of America and Ireland. “My music is doing great abroad and features international artists. I know that I am destined for greatness and I am working hard to make sure that it happens,” he said. He further attributed his success to the support he has received from his community. When he is not in studio, he likes gaming, playing indoor soccer and has recently gotten into Crossfit. His message to break into the music business is to always be up to date with the trends and mind the different genres that are making waves. “Don’t rush the process or you’ll burn out,” he concluded.
