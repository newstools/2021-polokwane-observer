It was recently reported that 80.7 per cent of ooba Home Loans applicants successfully obtained finance in the first quarter of 2021. Fifteen per cent of the applicants were rejected due to lack of affordability and poor credit score. Of these rejected homeowner hopefuls, a staggering 44 per cent were rejected by their own bank. So what do you do if you find yourself in this situation? “When applying for a home loan, you’d assume that your first stop would be your bank. However, a bank’s lending criteria are regulated by the National Credit Act and as a result, there’s no guarantee it will approve your home loan. “Based on this, we recommend spreading your risk by making use of a home loan comparison service to increase your chances of being approved at the best possible interest rate,” explains Rhys Dyer, CEO of ooba Home Loans.“We will apply to multiple banks on your behalf,” Dyer says. “We have successfully secured home loan financing for about two in every four applications that were initially turned down by their bank. This is because each bank makes use of different lending criteria when evaluating an application,” he continues. When banks assess home loans, their first step is to check your credit score. “A poor credit score is the most common reason for rejection. Luckily, there are ways to improve your standing before applying again,” explains Dyer. If your credit score is rated poor (below 600), it’s recommended that you obtain a copy of your credit report from the credit bureau. “If you identify errors on your credit report, the credit bureau should be notified of these and you should then take the necessary action to rectify the information displayed on the report,” adds Dyer. “If the information is correct and your poor credit score is the result of bad debts or having no credit history, you need to take more action.” * Source: Supplied on behalf of ooba Home Loans, ooba.co.za
