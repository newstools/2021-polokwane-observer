The Department of Education, which was allocated 38 000 Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 single dose vaccines, still has over 7 000 doses for the purposes of teacher vaccinations and support staff. Tidimalo Chuene, the Spokesperson for Education in Limpopo said instructions on how the remainder of people in the education sector will be vaccinated, will be communicated in due course. “We are happy with the turnout and continue to encourage teachers and other staff to register in order to be vaccinated in the coming days.” She emphasised that teachers should give an indication if they wish not to be vaccinated so that the vaccine can be allocated to other areas,” she said.
