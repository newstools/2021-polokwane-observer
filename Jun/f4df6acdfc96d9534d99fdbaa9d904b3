Physical activity provides numerous benefits for children. It strengthens their heart health, improves their flexibility and coordination, and, most importantly, establishes the foundation for a healthy lifestyle. Between 45 and 60 minutes of physical activity per day is recommended for children and adolescents. During the winter season, children can still stay fit by doing these fun indoor and outdoor activities. If it is too cold to go outdoors, indoor soccer games or dancing around the house are a great way to get the daily recommended time for physical activity. Technology is everywhere, intertwined in almost every part of our lives. There is great technology to get your children moving such as Xbox 360 Kinect, PlayStation Move and Nintendo Wii. These video games allow your kids to use their bodies as the controller – they can be an athlete, dancer, the UFC fighter or even the Kung Fu Panda punching and kicking on the screen. If you want to stay at home, the South African climate allows for children to still play outside during winter as the sun is out during the day and it’s warm until late afternoon. You can create an obstacle course using balls, skipping ropes and hula hoops for the children to play outside in the yard. A mini trampoline is also a fun way for them to get the much needed exercise for the day effortlessly. Alternatively, you and your child can bond while taking the dog for a walk. If you want to take them out for the day, ice-skating or hiking are great ways to get the recommended minutes of exercise. Just remember to keep them hydrated at all times.
