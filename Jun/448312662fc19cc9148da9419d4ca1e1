The 30-year-old make-up artist does make-up for clients who get their photos taken at Pro Image in Mall of the North. She is also the founder of My Beauty Spot, the business where she conducts her make-up artistry. She sells a brand called ‘O ska nfella pelo’, which is founded by Thabiso Moagi. The brand appeals to hustlers who keep working hard until they achieve their dreams and it also sends a message for other people to be patient, she said. Polly is finally doing what she loves after she left the insurance industry, where she worked before the lockdown affected her job. “When we went into lockdown, I had to find an alternative way to make a living. That was when I decided to develop my skills as a make-up artist,” she said. Polly offered her make-up services, looking for various opportunities until Pro Image welcomed her into the family. “I make sure that people look their best for the photos they take according to their specifications. I love what I do and seeing a client’s reaction to how good they look in the photos always brightens my day,” she said. Despite being in a field that she loves, Polly is studying education at Unisa, and plans to juggle her two passions one day. “I love children and I chose to work with the intermediate phase. I will be a teacher during the week and do make-up during the weekend,” she added. Polly plans to one day create employment through her make-up business. “I dream big. I want to have two branches in the near future. It’s important to always believe in yourself, stand on your own feet, and make use of the resources available to you,” she concluded.
