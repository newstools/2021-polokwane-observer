The next Mrs Universe Africa might just come from Limpopo. This pageant is open to women from all walks of life, be it married, divorced or widowed. Pageant scout Katryn Celliers said she scouted 28 women from the province and they are all semi-finalists. “We have 10 women from Polokwane who made it and the others are from Mokopane and surrounding areas,” she said. The semi-finalists will now have to each host a fundraiser and a charity project. They will have interviews on 13 August and on 14 August the top 20 finalists will be announced. Her message to the finalists: “This journey of self-discovery, growth and women empowerment will change your life – enjoy every moment. It is a life-changing experience where you will uplift and create positive change in your community. Being a role model and inspiration to others is your new duty as a Mrs Universe Africa semi-finalist; do your best and God will do the rest,” she concluded.
