“Shwii by Nissan is made with South Africans in mind. We are driving the local conversation on inclusivity, combined with smart technology by putting our local languages on the map.” said Stefan Haasbroek, the marketing director of Nissan South Africa. “When you speak to someone in their home language, they can understand and respond in time by reacting accordingly to any obstacle or potential danger around them, and that was one of the reasons behind this campaign to put our local languages on the map,” said Nokwe Ndwandwe, the brand manager of Nissan South Africa. While dozens of languages are available on apps like Waze, Zulu – spoken by roughly 16 million people, mostly in South Africa – was missing. With isiZulu and local Mzansi slang as the brand-new set of vocals, Nissan is fostering an environment of inclusivity – both inside and outside the car. Nissan and TBWA Hunt Lascaris were awarded for their creativity around the Shwii by Nissan campaign by the Creative Circle. The non-profit organisation is dedicated to promoting creativity as a business resource; it maintains high levels of creativity in the South African advertising industry and provides input into ACA, an official industry body. More local South African languages will soon be featured on the Waze platform, courtesy of Shwii by Nissan. Source: MotorPress
