The Polokwane team, Daine and Luisa de Bruyn, and Gorman and Evelyn Cloete defeated their counterparts to win the coveted trophy. President of Polokwane Bowls Club, Garry Blakemore said they were happy with the progress made by the players from the club. “It was a good event irrespective of the freezing cold weather in Polokwane. The pairs did well and proved that they are the best. However, I am happy with their overall performances.” Blakemore announced that he will be competing at a national inter-district mixed competition in Durban in the upcoming months. “I will be pairing with seasoned bowler, Lyn Lambert. We are ready and we are looking forward to the event.”
