The talented Matarutse is a revered producer and has worked with many local and international artists. He has also produced award-winning records over the years. He founded his record label in 2006 but only started functioning professionally in 2008. Matarutse has always wanted to be in music production and sound engineering. Although he had a natural talent, he is a firm believer in education and he went on to obtain a sound engineering qualification to back up his knowledge. “I currently divide my time between music production and sound engineering. When I am not in studio, I can be found at events making sure that the sound is stellar,” he said. Matarutse uses music as an escape. Whether he is happy or stressed, music is his go-to. He shared that like any other person, he also encounters creative blocks, especially when working with so many people. “I spend a lot of time practising in my free time, this is to get inspiration flowing and come up with new music ideas,” he said. He added that it is not easy being in the music industry, however with the passion and drive, it is worth it. “Every artist that comes here expects the best and that is exactly what I give them. It is important to have a jam session in studio before we start the actual work. This gets the music juices flowing and some of the best pieces of work can come out of that,” he said.
