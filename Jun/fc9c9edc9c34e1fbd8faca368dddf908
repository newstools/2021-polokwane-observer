Serves 12 (size dependant) You’ll need: 200g cake flour; 5ml bicarbonate of soda; 5ml baking powder; 20g soft butter; 110g Selati sugar; 30ml apricot jam; 125ml milk; 2 eggs; a pinch of salt. For the sauce: ½ cup fresh cream; 60g butter; 30ml Selati sugar; 30ml water. Crème Anglaise: ½ cup milk; ½ cup whipping cream; 5ml vanilla extract; 3 large egg yolks; 40g Selati sugar. How to: Pre-heat oven to 180°C. Dissolve bicarbonate of soda in the milk. Mix all other ingredients. Add bicarb and milk mixture to the other ingredients until well combined. Divide the mixture between 12 espresso cups and bake in a pre-heated oven for 15-20 minutes until cooked through. For the sauce: Place all ingredients in a pot and bring to a boil. In the meantime, prepare the crème anglaise by combining milk and cream in a medium saucepan. Add vanilla and bring to a simmer. Remove from heat. Whisk egg yolks and sugar in a medium bowl to blend. Gradually whisk the hot milk mixture into the yolk mixture. Return custard to the heat and stir over low heat until custard thickens and coats the back of the spoon (about 5 minutes). Do not boil. Strain custard into a bowl. Cover the surface of the custard directly with cling film to prevent skin from forming and chill. When the cups are done, pour the sauce over each one and leave it to cool slightly. Serve warm with crème anglaise. * Recipe & image by RCL Foods.
