Are you wondering how better to understand your toddler, stimulate their imagination, and help them learn about the world around them? Children develop quickly in the toddler years. As your toddler develops, you’ll probably find your relationship with him changes. Susanne Hugo, an occupational therapist, has these six top tips that will help you better relate to your toddler and improve your relationship. It’s not uncommon for your child to become frustrated while participating in an activity. One reason for this is that they may know what they want to do but not always how to do it. As a result, always try to gently guide your child and remember that you are only guiding them, not doing it for them. The good news is that your child should now be able to focus on an activity for at least 15 minutes and stay occupied for about an hour. Simply keep this in mind when selecting activities for them and allow them to play uninterrupted. At this age, role-playing becomes a lot more enjoyable, and it’s something you can use to teach your child a new skill. You can also use it to persuade them to do something they don’t necessarily want to do, such as bathing. Try pretending to be a fish or a shark in the bath to get your child to role-play. Arts and crafts can be a lot of fun! So start collecting old toilet paper rolls, scrap paper, and cotton wool for your child to play with. You’ll enjoy seeing what they can come up with, and it’ll keep them occupied for a long time. It’s never too early to begin teaching your child about rules and authority. You can also try playing more “rule-based” games at this age because they perceive it as very important. Keep in mind that your child will not be able to follow multiple instructions at this time, nor will he or she be able to follow instructions that are too complex. Choose simpler tasks and activities that don’t require a lot of explanation.
