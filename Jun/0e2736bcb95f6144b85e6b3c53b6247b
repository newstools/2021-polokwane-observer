The programme called AccelerateHer will start with ten women of Kwazulu-Natal. The programme, running over three years at the Commercial Transport Academy, will include, among other subjects, business training, transport management and safety. The reward for successful candidates will be a commercial drive qualification that will empower them to become operators within Lafarge KZN’s operations. “We believe that given the correct resources and support, these women-owned transport businesses have the potential to flourish and make a real change in the lives of the participants, their families and their communities,” said Noriko Solomon, Aggregates and ReadyMix director, Lafarge. Moreover, the Lafarge procurement director, Kervin Ali, added, “We understand that this project is another step towards economic inclusion; building accessible and sustainable communities for the future.”  Volvo Financial Services will finance the Volvo trucks. “We are excited about the new doors that will open for women in transport because of this joint initiative with Lafarge South Africa,” said Marcus Hörberg, vice president of Volvo Group Southern Africa. “As a big supporter of the difference women can make in the industry, we are very proud and humbled that the Volvo Trucks Iron Women project has been able to develop and grow, and make such a lasting impact in many people’s lives.” Source: Volvo
