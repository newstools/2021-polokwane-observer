The Limpopo Blue Bulls’ women’s team welcomed the Pumas from Mpumalanga for their encounter in group two of the competition. It proved to be an easy task for the ladies of the province as they ran in 11 unanswered tries, of which eight were converted. Koketso Mashiane scored a hat-trick and converted five penalties in the match, while Sebenzile Ramalepe, Valencia Mthembi, Nelly Semenya, Dorothy Maholola, Jibrine Dube, Tshepiso Lesudi and Tebogo Semenya also crossed the white wash. Mashiane said they dedicated their win to long-serving coach, Kobus Redelinghuys. “It was his last match as he will retire from the sport. We have learnt a lot from him and felt it would be honourable to play for him and send him off with a good result,” Mashiane said. Lesudi said they will miss Redelinghuys’s knowledge and passion for the game. “He is an astute coach who is easy to talk to and we want to thank him for guiding us all these years.” The win over the Pumas ensured the team’s first points on the log. They are grouped with the Leopards, Mastercard Golden Lions, Valke and Pumas, with the winner of the group advancing to the final. Mashiane said preparations are at an advanced stage for their match against the Falcons on Saturday. “We are ready for them. We want to continue our current form and do well in the league.”
