This is a lovely technique to learn if you love the look of rope shelves. Perhaps you want open shelving in your kitchen or somewhere to display your favourite home accessories in your living room. You can follow these steps using a new or an old scaffold plank. But if you don’t have one handy, a chunky wooden board will do. What really elevate this look is the way the rope itself is painted in Chalk Paint™ and frayed. This serves to add colour and a decorative flourish to an otherwise minimalist shelf design. Be sure to find your nearest Annie Sloan Stockist. Not only will they have all the tools you need for your next furniture transformation, but they will be able to give you all the guidance and support you need for all your DIY/Paint projects. Have Fun!!
