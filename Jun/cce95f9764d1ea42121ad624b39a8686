As winter dryness sets in, coupled with constant hand washing and sanitising, our hands take a daily beating. Try these easy homemade remedies to give your hands the deep nourishment they deserve. Mix equal amounts of olive oil and sugar. Scrub your hands for about 5 minutes in circular movements. Rinse and pat dry. Stir two tablespoons of ground oatmeal, a teaspoon of honey and a little water into a paste. Rub the mixture into your hands and leave it to dry so that it becomes a hand mask. Leave for 10 minutes. Rinse with warm water and pat dry. You can also add a little oatmeal to your bath at night to help moisturise your body. Apply about four tablespoons of warm coconut oil to your hands and gently rub your hands for five minutes of circular movements. Put on a pair of disposable gloves and wear them to bed so that the oil seeps into your skin. Rinse off in the morning and pat dry. * Source: Adapted from www.everydayhealth.com
