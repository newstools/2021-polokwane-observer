Jim, now 36 years old shared that he sometimes thinks of the influence that his dad may have had in his life and how things could have been different for him. “I can’t say I know my dad because I was so young when he passed away, but people always talk about him and that in a sense makes me feel like I knew him,” he said. Although he never had the opportunity to celebrate days like Father’s Day with his dad, he makes a point of visiting his grave and saying a few words. “I do this on Father’s Day, birthdays and on days when I miss him, because it brings me comfort. It has not been easy growing up without him. I was surrounded by love but it is not the same,” he said. He started visiting his father’s grave because of the hurt of seeing other children being able to talk about their dads and having them in their lives. “I made a decision that even though he is not with me physically, I believe he is my guardian and watches over me,” he added. Ramoroko believes that if his dad was around, he would use days like Father’s Day to celebrate him because just like mothers, fathers also deserve acknowledgement for their role in raising their children. “I urge everyone who still have dads to honour them while they are still around, because it’s difficult not having them around. There are many people who wish to have their dad physically present, why it makes it important to cherish every moment you have with them,” he added.
