When it comes to babywearing, as with anything else, your baby’s safety comes first. When using a baby wrap or other similar baby carrier, there are a few things to keep in mind… Please make an exception this time if you have never been a fan of reading instruction manuals. The effectiveness of your baby wrap is determined by how well you use it. The instructions for your baby wrap may differ depending on the brand and model. As a safety precaution, read the instructions again each time you buy a baby wrap. Babies come in a variety of sizes and shapes. While a one-size-fits-all baby carrier would be ideal, it is simply not possible. Have your baby’s weight and height on hand when you go shopping so you can pick the right baby wrap. Your baby can easily become entangled or, worse, suffocate in a baby wrap. Always check to ensure your baby’s face is uncovered and that the carrier is not too tight to prevent circulation. While it’s critical that your baby is safe and secure in a baby wrap, you should also consider your own comfort. If you have a sore back or poor posture as a result of using a baby wrap, seek medical advice before continuing to use it. Before each use, inspect your baby carrier for signs of wear. Look for frays or tears in the fabric and, if you find them, stop using it. The last thing you want is for your baby wrap to tear and send your child tumbling. When it comes to babywearing and cooking, there are so many things that can go wrong that it is simply not worth the risk. Cooking while wearing your baby can result in hotplate burns, panhandles being pulled, and spitting oil, to name a few dangers. While all of these safety precautions may appear intimidating, they are all common sense. A baby wrap, when used properly, is safer than carrying a baby in your arms.
