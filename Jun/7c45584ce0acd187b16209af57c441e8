Ombré effects aren’t just for fashion and beauty, you can achieve stunning colour blending on furniture and walls, too. Ombré – the subtle transition from one colour into another – might look a little daunting at first, but if you follow these simple steps, you’ll see just how straightforward and satisfying it can be. We suggest starting with a smaller project first – why not paint chair legs or how about coffee table legs? Once you’re feeling more confident, you can graduate to larger furniture or even walls! When you’re trying to create an ombré effect with paint, the first step is to choose your colours. You’ll want one pale colour and one dark colour. Experiment first by blending Chalk Paint™ colour combinations. Will you choose a sunset palette of dusky oranges and pinks or mermaid tones of blues and greens? Creating an ombré effect with paint is a great way to create a contemporary look on furniture and walls. The secret is in finding the colour combination that suits your style – but the good news is you can have so much fun experimenting with mixing different colours. Speak to your local Annie Sloan Stockist for advice on colour mixing and colour combinations that work.
