There’s good reason why we love making arts and crafts with felt. Felt is a popular crafting material because it’s easy to work with (cut edges won’t fray), comes in a variety of colours, and can even be embellished with tiny pieces. Here’s a bunch of projects using felt that toddlers, pre-schoolers and primary school-aged kids will love making today. Top tip: Felt can be hard to cut for little hands, so make sure you have really sharp scissors and always leave the cutting to adults. Cut round disks from felt and arrange in a circle and glue to a circular base (or stitch together). Then use buttons to decorate your centre. A little embroidery thread will provide some embellishment and can also be used to attach the flower to the Alice band. Search on the web for some lovely inspiration – there are wonderful ideas for finger puppets. Use a range of bright, popping colours to make your designs.

Stack and sew together and attach a simple safety pin to the back.
