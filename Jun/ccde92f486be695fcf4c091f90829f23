One of the most difficult challenges for a new mom in the first few years is figuring out how to get her baby to sleep. While there is plenty of advice on how much sleep babies should get in a 24-hour period and how to best get them into a sleep routine, there isn’t much on where they should sleep. A recent study published in the Journal of Paediatrics looked at over 11 000 infant deaths and discovered that 350 babies died while sitting in a sitting device such as car seats, baby swings, or bouncers. Babies can fall out of a sitting device, fall from an elevated surface such as a table or chair on which it has been placed, or flip onto a soft surface (such as a couch) and suffocate if it is not used as directed. They can also be injured or killed if they are not properly buckled up. Sleep-related deaths are the leading cause of death in infants aged one to twelve months. To avoid injury or death, the American Association of Paediatrics recommends that parents never leave their babies unattended in these devices, whether they are sleeping or awake.
