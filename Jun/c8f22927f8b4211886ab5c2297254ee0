What to watch this weekend? We’ve got you covered with three great movies – one for every mood. No matter how fast you are, no one outruns their past … Once again, get ready for action and speed on land and air with the ninth chapter of one of the most popular movies ever made; watch a seemingly anti-romantic comedy about a stand-up comic who meets a guy who seems perfect – smart, nice, successful… and possibly, too good to be true; and lastly, sit on the edge of your seat with a heart-pounding science fiction thriller that pulls you into the infinite and unforgiving realm of deep space. Dom Toretto is living the quiet life off the grid with Letty and his son, but they know that danger always lurks just over the peaceful horizon. This time, that threat forces Dom to confront the sins of his past to save those he loves most. His crew soon comes together to stop a world-shattering plot by the most skilled assassin and high-performance driver they’ve ever encountered … Dom’s forsaken brother. Fast & Furious 9 is now showing at a cinema near you.   After years of putting her career ahead of love, stand-up comic Andrea Singer stumbles upon the perfect guy on Netflix’s Good on Paper. On paper, Dennis checks all the boxes, but Andrea’s friend, Margot, is convinced he’s not all he appears to be.   Dr Ryan Stone is a medical engineer on her first shuttle mission. Her commander is veteran astronaut Matt Kowalsky, helming his last flight before retirement. Then, during a routine spacewalk by the pair, disaster strikes. The shuttle is destroyed, leaving Ryan and Matt stranded in deep space with no link to Earth and no hope of rescue. As fear turns to panic, they realize that the only way home may be to venture further into space. Watch Gravity now on Showmax.
