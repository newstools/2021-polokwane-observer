The grading was officiated by a panel of senseis from various local clubs who graded karatekas on kata, kumite, ipon-kumite and fitness. The panel also took into consideration the knowledge of karate terminology in both English and Japanese. Eleven karatekas took part in the grading in three categories and a winner with the highest grading in each category was announced.

The panel of senseis were to ensure that the quality of the grading is not compromised. Congratulations to all the karatekas that have received their belts.” Winners in the three categories: •Dean Craffery, junior white belt. •Zelandia Janse van Rensburg, senior white belt. •Wikus Viljoen, junior yellow belt.
