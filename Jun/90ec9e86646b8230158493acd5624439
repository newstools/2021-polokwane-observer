Sensei Annatjie de Jager says self defence and karate should be considered a basic need, especially considering the world that we live in. The dojo welcomed around eight new learners as part of their Youth Day initiative who trained and learned the basics of karate. “Some of these learners have great skills and abilities and I have asked some of them to join us on a regular basis. This was supposed to be a training session for a massive upcoming competition, and I though why not give some willing learners the opportunity to learn a new skill. Karate is ideal for children to help them build a positive character and to instill discipline, respect, etiquette, co-ordination, self-control, focus and social skills. It will also teach children that effort is needed to achieve success.” During the training session, some of the parents were also taught a thing or two about karate.
