Moses is the founder of Kingdom Benefit Foundation, which offers short courses, matric upgrades and extra lessons. He is giving the scholarships away to students from underprivileged communities. “I have realised that people are not registering because of the effects the Covid-19 pandemic has. Many of the parents have lost jobs and are unable to pay for their children to study, so I started the 2021 Covid-19 scholarship,” he explained. He added that he felt the need to help as no child should be left behind due to circumstances that are beyond their control. The learners will study for free, but they will, however, pay a once-off admission fee of R600 and an additional R300 for the Kingdom Benefit uniform. To qualify for the scholarship you need to be a South African citizen and you will have to bring a copy of your ID and a report of your academic results. “We have filled 250 spaces and 250 more spaces are available for those who are interested. The deadline is 30 April. Take the opportunity to study for free,” he said. He appealed to sponsors to jump on board and assist with making the scholarships a success because it takes a village to raise a child. Kingdom Benefit Foundation was founded in 2016 and started out by doing one-on-one lessons. As the number of learners increased, it moved to the Mimosa building at 58 Market Street, opposite Metropolitan. WhatsApp 071 304 7108 for more information.
