During the tabling of the budget last week, she said it is critical to note that the equitable share allocation includes an amount of R1,9 billion earmarked for the fight against Covid-19. “In monetary terms, the total budget indicates a decline from R22,6 billion in 2020/21 to R22,0 billion in 2021/22 from the adjusted allocation. This demonstrates that the department is currently experiencing financial strain and will do so for the foreseeable future.” The budget has been allocated to fund the following key priorities of the department: • Covid-19 budget is further augmented by R168 million conditional grant for Covid-19 vaccination. • District health services has been allocated R11 billion. This represent 50% of the total budget. • R4,4 billion has been allocated for tertiary, regional, and specialised hospitals. • Malaria control is funded with R94,2 million in equitable share and an additional R62,7 million conditional grant in order to prevent and control malaria in the affected areas of this province. • R42,2 million has been provided for TB programme. • Comprehensive HIV and AIDS program has been allocated R2,2 billion. • R885,2 million has been set aside for the running of Emergency Medical Services in the province, including purchase of ambulances. • An amount of R1,4 billion has been allocated to Health Infrastructure Programme, including Covid-19. • R198,7 million has been allocated for the training of health professionals. This amount covers medical students in the Republic of Cuba, Limpopo Medical School and other medical schools in the country. • R1,5 billion has been allocated for medicine. This includes an amount of R804,5 million for the provision of antiretroviral drugs to HIV positive patients and new intake, and R200,8 million for vaccines to reduce infant and child mortality.
