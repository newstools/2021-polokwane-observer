Expected at the event are men and women bowlers from 12 bowling clubs across the province. President of Polokwane Bowls Club, Garry Blakemore said Saturday will be the play-offs while Sunday is scheduled for finals. “This will be our first major event after a long break due to Covid-19 restrictions. We are happy, we just want to get on the field and play. The virus was a big upset for sport across the world. We are looking forward to the two day event over the weekend.” Last Friday, groundsmen at the club were hard at work ensuring that it is in pristine condition for the event. The bowls are played on a large, rectangular, precisely leveled and manicured grass or a synthetic surface known as a bowling green, which is divided into parallel playing strips called rinks. Blakemore said they started working on the pitch weeks ago in preparation of the event. “The pitch is cut twice on Friday for Saturday and Sunday matches. The bowling pitch must look like a pool table. The ball must just move with ease and there must be no obstacles. It is important to keep it flat and green at all times so that the players can enjoy their strokes and shots. It is like a golf green, it must always be smooth and kept very short at all times.”
