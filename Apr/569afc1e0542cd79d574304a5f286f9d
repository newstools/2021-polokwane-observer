The event was hosted by Doek On Fleek Nation Movement, a 100% black female-owned organisation that prides itself on employing and empowering young females. It was founded by Thandi Mavata in 2016 with the aim to celebrate women, their tenacious spirit as well as self-love and love for those around them. “The Doek Nation Movement has spread throughout the nine provinces and in recent months we have introduced the movement to our neighboring African countries such as Botswana, Lesotho and Zimbabwe. Our main focus in all these events is always the unity and empowerment of women by exposing them to opportunities within their communities as well as providing them with information of empowerment initiatives designed for women. We also use these events to give locals and small business owners a platform to showcase their talent and products, but most importantly the events have become a safe space for women to let their hair down and fully enjoy themselves in the company of other women,” she explained. The event was attended by both young and old in a garden setting, where guests brought their camp chairs, blankets and picnic baskets. Guests also decorated their own picnic space as they saw fit, to give it an On Fleek picnic experience ambiance. “I enjoyed myself today as I always look for such empowering and positive events to attend, and this one has met all expectations. I feel empowered and braver than before to go out there and continue to work on myself so that I can become the best version of myself, professionally and socially as both aspects play important roles in life. I look forward to attend more of these events in the future,” said Refilwe Manaka, one of the guests. The ladies socialised while a DJ played music to keep them entertained, while having fun. Local businesses were also given the opportunity to showcase their products.
