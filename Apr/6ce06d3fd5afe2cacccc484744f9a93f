There are currently eight buses in operation, with a capacity of 54 passengers – 34 seated and 20 standing, with one allocated wheelchair space. The dry run is meant to test the various elements developed for operations to effect the necessary changes when and how required. Malose Lamola, the Director of Roads and Transport, said the national Department of Transport has set the regulation of capacity of the buses at 70% to be in line with Covid-19 regulations. The dry run, which started in January, is important to iron out teething problems in the next month. The launch date of Leeto la Polokwane will be determined by the national Department of Transport. “We feel our operators have been trained sufficiently to start carrying passengers. In the second half of the year, we should be in a position to have the full launch of the system,” he said. The drivers were trained to meet the requirements of operating a bus and to ensure a smooth run. Solly Ledwaba, the Chairperson of the vehicle operating company, Esilux, explained that the taxi industry has embraced the Leeto la Polokwane bus service. Safety and security plans have been developed in collaboration with the municipality and the police to avert crime, while the plan furthermore includes to have cameras along the routes and identify hotspots.
