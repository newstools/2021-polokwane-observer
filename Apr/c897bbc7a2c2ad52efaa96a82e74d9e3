She is a 33-year-old speech therapist and audiologist with a practice in Bendor and a special interest in balance and dizziness. She explained that she has always been talkative and sometimes feels it was destined that she ended up in her field as a result of her personality. “My late father used to call me 24 because I talked 24/7. Not much has changed since then,” she joked. She has worked in speech therapy and audiology for 11 years, but this was not her first choice for a career. She initially wanted to study medicine but did not qualify. As a second option, she had to choose between becoming a dietician or a speech therapist and audiologist. “I fell in love with speech therapy and audiology along the way and I have not looked back since. There is nothing more fulfilling than seeing the results of my treatment. Mind you, I am a crybaby. I cry, whether it is from happiness or sadness when I evaluate the progress of my clients,” she explained. The major challenge she faces in her job is the internet doctors, she says. People come for help but also consult Google and come up with their own diagnosis. Another challenge is the complexities of the field because speech therapy and audiology deals with parts that cannot be seen. People can be reluctant in believing that speech and hearing difficulties can be treated and corrected. “My son has speech difficulties as well, so I understand the frustrations and fears parents have. I am very strict with the parents to do the home programmes as it requires commitment,” she said She plans on growing her practice and wants to help create awareness about speech therapy and audiology as a career option. She is also open to mentoring young speech therapists and audiologists. “I want more people to explore the potential of the different areas within this field because there are many avenues to pursue. I, however, advise that people follow their heart and find where their passion lies first,” she said.
