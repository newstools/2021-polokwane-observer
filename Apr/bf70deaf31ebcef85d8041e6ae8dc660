Balancing work and being a dad who travels a lot presents unique challenges. And, to make everything just a little harder, decades of research and hundreds of studies have proven that the more involved a dad is, the more successful his children will be. Recent studies show that a father’s influence can determine a child’s social life, grades, and future achievements. There’s no doubt that frequent travel could impact on your kids, so you’ll need a parenting plan. This is how you can make it work: Do a few special one-on-one things with each of your kids before you leave. Build up a reservoir of time and go to the zoo, on a hike or have a picnic in the back yard. This is a tough one, but when you’re at home, wake up early and play with them for a couple of hours. They will love it! It’s like filling the bank account, the memories get withdrawn later. Show your kids when you will be leaving and when you’ll be home. Decorate a special box together and have your child keep special items, such as drawing and photos) in it to share with you when you return. Have someone videotape a game or a performance that your travels may cause you to miss. When you get home, make a big event out of watching it together. To make parting easier, give your little one a hug and a kiss saying, “I love you, I can’t wait to see you when I get back, but I know you’re going to have fun.” Then leave. Skype, Facetime, MMS, pics, text, and so on. Maybe, create a blog just to upload videos for the home team. Put a photo in easy-to-find places like a toy box or a favourite shoe. Squeeze in a late meeting and fly home instead of waiting another day, if possible. Just a small token to say that you’ve missed them. Get creative, maybe buy a magnet board and pick up a magnet every time you’re away.
