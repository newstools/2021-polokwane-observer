The General Secretary of the association, Michael Grobler, says that the association along with the victims have played their part in reporting the matter to the police and cases have been opened but justice is taking its time. “Enough material was supplied to the police, including video footage from the day but still we have not seen any arrests. These people are still on the street terrorising the community and it is affecting our businesses as well.” Grobler says the longer the culprits stay on the street, the more damage is caused. “Customers no longer want to come here out of fear. On a daily basis we receive complaints from people whose wallets disappear from their handbags, or whose cell phones are snatched and they are stranded. “They obviously come to us and we have to assist them because they are our customers. This also has an effect on the taxi business because we often need to arrange with drivers to take our customers home for free after they have been robbed.” Grobler says this is sending the wrong message, because it currently looks as if the criminals are running the town. A driver from the Mankweng Taxi Association, who opted to remain anonymous, agreed. “We transport around six people per day for free because they have been robbed by the same group of people,” he said, “we cannot send them away, we need to transport them home because they are our people and they are also just victims.” Police Spokesperson Brig Motlafela Mojapelo had not responded at the time of publishing.
