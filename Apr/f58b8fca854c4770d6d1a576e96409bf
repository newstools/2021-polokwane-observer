New Rotarians; Tebogo Ramulongo and Nadine Daly attended the ceremony in person while Ian Barnard was inducted via Zoom. The Chairperson of the Club, Grant Daly, welcomed the new Rotarians and said the club has great ambitions of attracting members from all over Limpopo and further afield. He alluded to the fact that Rotary’s theme for 2020/21 is ‘Rotary connects the world’ and that the theme for 2021/22 will be ‘Serve to change lives’. “Being an E-club makes it possible to have most of our meetings virtual and reach members that cannot attend in person but can still participate in club activities and make a meaningful contribution,” Daly explained, adding that the club will host quarterly in-person meetings in Polokwane or Haenertsburg to allow those members for whom it is possible to enjoy the fellowship that all Rotarians cherish. Daly also took the opportunity to present a Major Donor Level 2 Award to Dr Jim Blessman, who attended the meeting on Zoom. The award was accepted by Blessman’s son, Dustin.
