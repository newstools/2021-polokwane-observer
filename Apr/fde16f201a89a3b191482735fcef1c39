In Grimbeek Street in Extension 6, eight streetlights are not functioning. Resident Henk Joubert says the area has been without working streetlights since November. “The streetlights are not working and the crime on this street is rife. It has become a hotspot and despite reporting it to the municipality, nothing is being done,” he added. Joubert is in possession of a reference number from the last time he reported the matter to the municipality, however, his efforts remain fruitless, he told Polokwane Observer. He has not seen anybody from the municipality assess the situation or acknowledge that they are aware and working towards fixing the problem. The residents noticed in December that there were cables hanging down poles, which seem to have been cut. “I am one of the few whose house has not been broken into and I consider myself lucky. The last break-in we had was at the house of the most senior person in our street. We have pallisades but the cover of darkness allows criminals to do whatever they please,” he added. A business owner in the street, who chose to remain anonymous, said the situation negatively affects his business. His business was burgled late last year and he has had to take more safety precautions to protect his business. “I have had to improve security and put up CCTV cameras to monitor what happens around the property. Safety has become a serious issue as a result of the streetlights not functioning,” he said. The municipality has noted an increase in the number of these complaints, according to Spokesperson, Thipa Selala. Some of the complaints are sent through by ward councillors and others are received on their social media platforms. “The main challenge is vandalism on this service infrastructure. In terms of maintenance, the municipality targets a particular area at a particular time. The municipality is putting up measures to deal with street lights issues as part of its budget adjustment,” he added.
