The party’s National Spokesperson, Sisiwe Gwarube said the suspension followed a briefing from the Federal Legal Commission on the disciplinary matters involving Smalle. “On the basis of that briefing, the FedEx decided to suspend Smalle from party activities and caucus activities, pending a full investigation into all allegations made against him.” Smalle has been investigated for irregularities, and this resulted in the postponement of the province’s elective conference and as the tenure of the then leadership was to expire on 20 March, the two administrators took office on 18 March. Contacted for comment, Smalle confirmed his suspension and said he still plans on contesting the allegations made against him.
