Local football administrator and founder of First Touch Ladies Football Club in Polokwane, Mmoa Kekana said they are grateful to be the beneficiaries of the training apparel and a soccer kit donated to them by Selaki Sport and Leisure at Noordelikes Rugby Club last Thursday. The company handed over training apparel and a soccer kit worth R100 000 to First Touch Ladies Football Club as well as MaIndies Football Club who have won several local and national women soccer competitions in the past years. First Touch has also been doing well in the South African Football Association (Safa) National Women’s League and is also in need of permanent sponsors. They are the only team from the province plying trade at the Safa league. The donation also included a brand new home-and-away soccer kit, tracksuits, balls and training equipment. Kekana said it is difficult to run a soccer club without resources and they are grateful to be chosen by Selaki Sport and Leisure. “This will come in handy. We had a soccer kit and training equipment but is was not enough to cater for everyone. The gesture will also motivate the players and propel them to strive for more,” Kekana said. Mahlako Mahapa, founder and owner of Selaki Sport Leisure said the gesture formed part of recognising women in sport. “Women’s sport is always sidelined and underfunded. We as Selaki Sport and Leisure wants to be the change. We want to lighten their burden and make sure that they enjoy their favourite sporting code without any obstructions.”
