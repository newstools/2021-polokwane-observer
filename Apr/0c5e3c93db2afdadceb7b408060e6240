Did you know that socialising is one of the most complex skills children will learn? Being around peers, children witness and practice important social skills, such as cooperation, compromise, and healthy competition. Such relationships also give children feedback on how they are doing compared to others and contribute to the growth of their self-image. If your little one is not attending a nursery or playgroup on a regular basis, you can start introducing her to new friends by arranging regular playdates. Invite three or four friends and even older children (preschoolers), as young children may learn new skills from them. Top tip: Make sure to supervise the little ones, as older children may play a bit rough for the likes of the smaller children. Don’t interfere unnecessarily – give them space to explore their surroundings and themselves. Timing is everything when it comes to kids. Avoid arranging play dates late in the afternoon as you may end up with a group of cranky kids the later it gets. Playtimes shouldn’t be longer than 90 minutes. But 45 minutes should be enough for little ones. If the kids play well together, you could stretch the time a bit. Make sure you provide the children with similar toys during playtime to prevent them from fighting about whose turn it is to play with a specific toy. If you don’t want them to play with toys, take them on an outing or just let them run around and play. If your child isn’t as outgoing as the others in the group, it’s important to let her set her own pace when making friends. She may prefer you to stay with her while she finds her way around her newly found friends. Be there for your child and assure her that many children are shy initially, but the better she gets to know her friends, the more pleasant the play dates will be. If she is really having a hard time, you could leave the playdate earlier.
