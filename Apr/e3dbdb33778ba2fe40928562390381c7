Spokesperson for the Polokwane Municipality, Thipa Selala says low water levels at the Krugersburg reservoirs are causing periodic supply challenges to several high lying areas in the city. Selala says as of this morning Krugersburg 50Ml was sitting at 11%, Krugersburg 30Ml Dome at 10% and Krugersburg 30Ml Flat was at 5%. As a result water supply to the Thornhill, Marula Heights, Bolivia, Northview , Mall of the North and surrounding areas has been affected. The municipality has since deployed water tankers to all affected areas to assist with water supply. All users receiving supply are urged to use water sparingly, he added. “The municipality is working closely with Lepelle Northern Water (LNW)in an effort to improve reservoir levels,” Selala concluded.
