The organisations got together on Saturday, 11 April in Hans Van Rensburg Street to cook food for job seekers as well as homeless dwellers in the city. The initiative being the first of its kind, aims to inspire and motivate as well as encourage other organisations and companies in Polokwane to lend a helping hand where they can. “We plan to keep the spirit of Ubuntu alive with this initiative. We believe in helping those in need as every person has a right to food and shelter. Wherever we can meet people half way to make ends meet and make life easy and bearable, we will gladly step in and help. “We at Dr Patience Ntuli Ministries always ensure to give back whenever we can. Occasionally and on special days such as Christmas, we receive donations to feed those in need and we always take the opportunity and play our role to the best of our ability. “On Sundays after church we serve bread and soft drinks and plan to do Sunday feedings in the mornings with a light meal and full meal once every quarter,” she explained. Beneficiaries included job seekers as well as homeless people residing in the city, especially those in the vicinity of Biccard Street and Mokone Garage in Grobler Street. Thyrest donated food and face masks.
