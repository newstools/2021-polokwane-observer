If parents had a magic wand we’d probably have used it hundreds of times to safeguard our children from failure and disappointment. We’d be their own personal fairy godmother, and make all bad and difficult things in their lives vanish, so that their lives are easy. But in doing so, we would be withholding very important life experiences and lessons from our children. Failure is experienced when you feel that what you thought you’d achieve, wasn’t achieved. You become disappointed when your expectations aren’t met. Both of these emotions are painful, and most people do their best to avoid disappointment and failure. Yet these very painful emotions and experiences are the building blocks and cement in building resiliency and emotional intelligence. We chat with psychologist, Ilze van de Merwe-Alberts on how you can help your child deal with failure and disappointment.
