Although going on vacation can be both fun and exciting, the process of planning your trip can be stressful, especially when it comes to finding the perfect accommodation. Because it will be your home base during your vacation, where you choose to stay may make or break your vacation. There are many factors to consider when selecting the right travel accommodation option for yourself and possible companions joining you on your trip. Consider the number of people you’re travelling with The number of people you’re travelling with determines what type of accommodation you should book. If you’re travelling in a large group, a hotel may be less financially viable as you’ll end up paying more for multiple rooms. In this case, you may want to consider booking a hostel or an Airbnb. Compare accommodation prices in relation to your budget Before booking, it’s important to do price comparisons to find accommodation that will offer you more for less. There are many websites that will help you easily compare rates as well as offer great deals and packages. You should also make sure you check the accommodation’s website (if they have one) to compare the price to the rates being featured on booking websites. Consider the length of your trip If your vacation is lengthy, you’ll need to stay in a place that offers convenience as well as a great rate. You may also want to consider going with an accommodation options that include laundry facilities, a kitchen, and other amenities. An Airbnb or apartment-type accommodation is perfect for longer stays, whereas accommodations like hotels and hostels are good options for short-term stays. Consider your arrival time/check-in and check-out times The time you’ll arrive at your accommodation influences which accommodation you can book. This is important to note as hotels are not strict regarding how late guests check-in whereas establishments like Airbnbs prefer earlier check-ins and may even charge extra fees for guests who check-in late. Always check the accommodation’s cancellation policy Life is unpredictable and sometimes travel plans change, so make sure you’re booking at an accommodation that has a flexible cancellation policy. You don’t want to end up forfeiting your hard-earned cash or paying exorbitant cancellation fees just because you can no longer go on a vacation or if certain aspects of your travel plans have changed. Always check the reviews before booking You need to have a clear picture of what your stay at your chosen accommodation will be like. Check for reviews on Google or various travel platforms and make sure you check out previous guests’ pictures, where possible, to see if they match the pictures of the accommodation featured on the booking website. You can also go through reviews on the booking site to see what guests have said about their experience. If an accommodation doesn’t have many reviews, it’s best to avoid it. Consider a self-catering accommodation If you’re looking to save money, booking a self-catering accommodation may be a great idea. It will be much cheaper to cook your own food than to pay for room service at a hotel, buy takeout, or eat out at a restaurant continuously. Check if there’s a free airport shuttle If you’re travelling by plane, keep in mind that getting from the airport to your accommodation can be costly, especially if the airport is quite a distance away. If you’re booking a hotel, choosing one that offers a free airport shuttle can save you some money on transportation costs. Consider the location of the accommodation Choosing an accommodation that is central and well-connected to transport routes will help you navigate the area easily and save on transportation costs, whether you’re driving, using a ride-share service or other forms of public transport. Consider the safety of the accommodation Safety is such an important factor to consider, especially if you’re staying in a hostel or an Airbnb. Hotels usually have good security, but even then, it doesn’t hurt to check what additional security measures they have in place. Check the amenities at the accommodation It’s important to book an accommodation that offers you great amenities. Things such as a swimming pool, a restaurant, a gym, and more, may be something you’d like to consider depending on your personal preferences and requirements. By taking the above factors into consideration, you can ensure that booking your next travel accommodation is a more seamless experience that contributes to the fun and memorability of your vacation.
