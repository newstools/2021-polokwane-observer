Did you know that encouraging your child to play sports has long-term benefits for their bone health and could help protect them from osteoporisis in later life? A study that followed 984 children into adulthood found that participation in organised sport during childhood and adolescence is associated with bone mass at 20 years of age. Researchers found that males who were ‘consistent sport participators’ from ages five -17 years had significantly greater whole body and leg bone mineral content at age 20 years than those who dropped out of sport, whereas males who ‘joined sports’ had significantly greater leg bone mineral content than those who dropped out of sport. Girls who were ‘consistent sport participators’ had significantly greater leg bone mineral content at 20 years of age than those who dropped out. Because attainment of optimal peak bone mass in young adulthood is protective against osteoporosis later in life, participation in organised sport may have long-term skeletal benefits. “Targeted messages to young males and females that discourage dropping out of sport and encourage joining sport – even in adolescence – are important for the benefits of skeletal health,” said lead author Dr Joanne McVeigh, of Curtin University, in Australia.
