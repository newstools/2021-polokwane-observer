Speaking at an event celebrating the launch of the forum, Jay Nkuna, in representing the Public Protector’s office in Polokwane, reiterated that the service is open to all. “Our office’s key mandate and role are to investigate improper conduct in government or state entities. This include issues such as maladministration, corruption and undue delay in all government departments and other state-owned entities.” Nkuna said this is done after the complainant has exhausted all internal remedies available and has not received any assistance. “We investigate issues that have to do with ethics and morals in a public service environment and how people conduct themselves in the office.” These issues include state departments, public servants and state-owned entities’ conduct towards clients, target groups, the employer/employee relationship as well as the relationships between colleagues.Nkuna said there are many challenges in government institutions, and some take time to be resolved. It can also include issues such as sexual harassment, when most of the time there are no witnesses. Should another complaint against the same person be lodged, it makes the investigation easier, although it may take time. “People sometimes do what they like instead of what they are supposed to do. We are living in a confused society where some people are no longer guided by morals and principles to regulate their conduct.” Nkuna emphasised that their services are free, but currently, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, no walk-in services are available. People should phone their office at 071 881 3840 or visit their website for assistance. She said they used to have an office in Musina, but that the mini regional office has been relocated to Thohoyandou and is situated next to the Victim Empowerment Office.Once 100% visitation is allowed in terms of lockdown regulations, citizens can visit the office in Polokwane at 18A Landdros Maré Street for assistance.
