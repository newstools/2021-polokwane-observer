We all know we need to save, but some of us aren’t quite sure how to. This week, I’ve decided to equip you all with helpful tips on how to save monthly. I believe these are vital steps to be mindful of in order to succeed! As an accountant with access to client financial records, I can confidently say that people who save are always successful in business, personal finances and general well-being. This is conclusive and there is simply no debate about this finding. I suggest you save at least 15%pm of your gross monthly income. There are many creative ways to save and be frugal. Start by looking at how much you spend daily in order to start ‘wasting less’. This exercise could help save you anything between R1000 to R10000 per month. So, try to maintain the focus and keep disciplined and watch as your Investments steadily grow over time. If you need help starting your savings journey or assistance on any other financial matters … feel free to contact me on any of the below-mentioned platforms!
