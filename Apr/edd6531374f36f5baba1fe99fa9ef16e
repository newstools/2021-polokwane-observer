Growing old is a blessing for some while others might experience it differently. For Tilly Davis, who celebrated her 91st birthday on Thursday, life and getting older is all about fun, jokes and laughter. When asked about her secret on how to reach the 90s, she immediately attributes it to her daily exercises. “I do 50 to this side and 50 to that. Then it is 50 here and 50 there,” she laughs while demonstrating her moves while sitting. Tilly was born in Zimbabwe and lived in Bulawayo. In 1980, after her husband passed away, she and her four children moved to South Africa. “One of my children passed away and one lives in New Zealand. My oldest daughter is in Cape Town and the other one in Polokwane. I also have quite a few grandchildren.” For the past two years Tilly have been part of Jo-Ann Rusoord where she spends her time reading and knitting. She loves music, plays the keyboard and loves to sing. “I do not follow a special diet, but I do get out of bed at 05:00 and prepare my own breakfast and lunch. I eat fruit salad every day and love to have soup in the evening. And all jokes aside, I do stretch my muscles for some exercise.”
