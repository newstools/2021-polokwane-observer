Crafts are a great way to keep kids entertained during the weekend. If you’re not keen on spending loads of money buying expensive art supplies, then you’ve come to the right place! Making a toilet roll fish is super easy and, best of all, super cost-effective. All you need to make these cute fish are toilet rolls, paint, and googly eyes. We’ve painted ours in different colours, but you can also use different bits and pieces of paper to decorate them. You might have to help your little one with the cutting, but after that, he can decorate his fish however he wants to.
