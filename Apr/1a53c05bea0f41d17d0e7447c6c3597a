The 15-year-old has been riding bikes for almost three years and is loving every minute of it. She used to be a horse rider but when she developed an allergic reaction to horses, she had to quit horse riding. However, all was not lost because she exchanged the animal for an iron horse. MagLynn remembers her first time on her bike as exciting. “I felt confident because the horse riding contributed to me being able to master the bike effortlessly,” she explained. After her first ride, she was so confident that she tried to convince her parents to allow her to ride to school on her own on a scooter at the age of 13. MagLynn comes from a family of riders and she has the most natural feel for the bike. This was confirmed by her father who said that bike riding is built into boys until he was proven wrong by her effortless and flawless ability to ride, ever since she got on a bike for the first time. She expressed that there is nothing more satisfying than having a good round on the track and spectators gasping when you take off your helmet and they realise that you are a girl. Her mother, René explained that they are proud of their daughter. “She never quits and will try over and over again until she gets something right. She is also a go-getter, always up for a challenge and enjoys proving people wrong when they claim that something cannot be done,” she said. MagLynn’s next off-road event will be in October in Roedtan. She spends her Saturdays on the track with family practicing and honing her riding skills. “This can be straining but it is worth every ache and pain,” she said. She is passionate about the bushveld and would like to go into wildlife conservation or manage a game farm one day. “For now, I work hard to complete my high school career and love socialising with friends. I also love chocolate, anytime and the more the merrier, she added.
