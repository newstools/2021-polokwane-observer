Remember a makeover (even a mini one) doesn’t happen overnight. It takes time to find a look and system that works for you. Start with a good wardrobe clear-out and do it Marie Kondo style. Anything that doesn’t spark joy or you haven’t worn in over a year should be donated or given away. Separate your clothes into seasons and follow these useful guidelines. New paint colour? Walls and ceilings painted in the same or very similar colours give the illusion of a bigger space. You also want a look that’s fresh and light, but not too sterile so go for slightly warmer tones. Decor tip: If you don’t have a walk-in closet or enough cupboard space, allocate some extra wall space for a fashion rail, and use baskets and shelves for added storage. A hat stand is also a win for caps, hats and even necklaces and you could store handbags upright in an old trunk placed at the end of your bed.
