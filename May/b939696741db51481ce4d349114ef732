The 25-year-old from Westenburg is a wellness coach with a passion for helping people to become the best versions of themselves. She is big on fitness, however, she also recognises the importance of having a balance between a healthy body, healthy mind and overall healthy lifestyle for a person’s wellbeing. “As a life coach, my job is to bring people to the realisation that a healthy lifestyle is not a chore nor is it a destination. I help people’s physical and emotional state, help them set goals for what they want to achieve in their overall wellness and health by working with them on plans of action to reach personal goals,” she explained. She has been a wellness coach since 2019 and believes that she is serving her life’s purpose. Fitness is a big part of her life, explaining that her mother says that even as a child, she was constantly running instead of walking. She took part in sport at school and competed at provincial level; however, she took up fitness seriously after completing her electrical engineering studies. “My parents believed that fitness is just a hobby and not anything that can be pursued at a higher level so I had to get a formal qualification,” she said. Kgantshi reiterated the importance of staying healthy and prioritising wellness because it not only makes you feel better but it also increases productivity. “Every emotion relates to our wellbeing. In turn, our wellbeing directly affects our actions and emotions. Therefore, it is important for everyone to achieve optimal wellness in order to subdue stress, reduce the risk of illness and ensure positive interactions,” she said. Kgantshi hosts fit-camp weekends which are free of charge. You can contact her at 072 085 4601 for more information.
