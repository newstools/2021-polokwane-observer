A number of studies have shown that, in the case of a vehicle accident, injuries are prevented and lives saved when adults and children are properly restrained. Sadly, many parents don’t properly restrain their children, or they allow them to sit in the front seat using adult seatbelts or to play in the back of the car without any restraints whatsoever. Children and babies are much more vulnerable to injury than adults, and adult seatbelts often don’t adequately restrain them during an accident. Children need to be strapped in using properly designed child safety seats that are secured in the rear of the car. These seats are highly effective in preventing injury and should be used every time you travel in the car with your child. Rear-facing child seats have been shown to reduce injury by as much as 76% and severe injury by 92%. Forward-facing restraints are less effective but still reduce injury by 34% and severe injury by 60%. A child who is standing between the two front seats at the time of an accident has the greatest chance of being injured or of not surviving the accident. Children can also be severely injured by airbags if these are activated while the child is in the front seat.
