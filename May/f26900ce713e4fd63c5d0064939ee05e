The team lifted the trophy after they beat their nemesis KwaZulu-Natal 5-4 in the finals held in Kempton Park last Saturday. Dinare as they are affectionately known in the softball circles eliminated the teams from the Free State, Gauteng and Mpumalanga on their way to the finals. Benny Boshomane, national member of Softball South Africa’s executive and guardian of Limpopo Softball Association said they were happy with players’ consistency during the national tournaments. “We won the title in 2019 and we are happy to win it again this year. These players were professional throughout the tournament and they did well to defend the title. They have set a good benchmark for the up-and-coming players from our development ranks. “They are creating a legacy for themselves and the association,” Boshomane said. “This is the standard we want to maintain. We are blessed, we have young committed players who are also in the national team set up. “We can only be proud as an association.”
