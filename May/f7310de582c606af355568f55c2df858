Welgegund Heritage Wines only bottles premium high-end wines in great years – and 2019 proved to be great indeed. So the trio of just released, award-winning, limited edition, numbered bottles are highly rated. There’s a Welgegund Heritage Wines Chenin Blanc 2019, a Cinsault 2019, and a bright Grenache Noir 2019 – soft, smooth and refined, which you should serve cooler than your usual red, and is lovely with a charcuterie board, salmon or a smoked mussel pot, or after dinner with a chocolate fondant.
