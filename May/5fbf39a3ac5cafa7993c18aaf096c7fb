The 28-year-old beat 156 professional golfers who participated in the championship for a R481 901 prize money and a trophy. Stone was quoted saying: “I managed to get over the line with a perfect par 5 play during the play-off followed by a perfect 3 and a perfect 2. If I am not mistaken it is the first one I won as a pro. I would be lying if I said I was not nervous on the first tee. Anyone in the Sunshine Tour, European Challenge Tour and PGA Tour, all you need is an opportunity.” He also thanked Limpopo Tourism Agency for organising the tournament and inviting players from other countries. “I would like to thank Limpopo Tourism coming together with Sunshine Tour and European Challenge Tour to put this event together bringing us to this fantastic venue in a special province is a huge opportunity.” Ludwick Manyama, Tournament Director at Sunshine Tour, also hailed the tournament a huge success as it went according to plan with all the players expressing their gratitude. “We hope to sustain this partnership as it adds a lot of value to the sport tourism in the country. We will continue to use golf as the vehicle to showcase the amazing tourism gems of South Africa to the world. We hope to renew our partnership with Limpopo Tourism Agency for more tournaments,” Manyama said. LTA Board Chairperson, Andrew Dipela said tournaments of this nature help boost the economy especially after the tourism sector was negatively affected by Covid-19. Dipela indicated that the tournament, which is now an international event, will continue to be supported as it brings relief to tourism in the province and Waterberg region in particular.
