Young men from various villages in the province keen to undergo a rite of passage in a boy’s journey to manhood at an initiation school, will have to wait for next year. This follows the announcement by Limpopo House of Traditional Leaders who decided on Monday that there won’t be any initiations this year. Chairperson of the House, Malesela Dikgale said they have decided to postpone the programme to next year due to Covid-19. “We cannot risk the lives of young men, so we decided to suspend all initiation school activities. Koma won’t go anywhere. It will still be with us in the coming years,” Dikgale said. He also warned that traditional leaders who are planning to open initiation schools without their permission will face the full might of the law. “We have been told that some leaders in Sekhukhune are planning to open initiation schools. We will be working with the South African Police Service to monitor such and ensure that no one opens any initiation school.” Initiation schools are cultural schools which young males and females attend to be taught the values, principles, hardships, respect and accountability within their cultural tradition.
