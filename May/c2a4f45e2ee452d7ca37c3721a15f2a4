Serves 4-6 You’ll need: McCain Mashed Butternut; McCain Wedges; 8 pork neck chops (2 per person); 2 tablespoon olive oil; 1 heaped tablespoon butter; 1 small onion, finely chopped; 2 tablespoons whole-grain mustard; 1 teaspoon dried thyme; 1 teaspoon dried sage; 1 teaspoon paprika; 1 teaspoon garlic powder; 1 cup chicken stock; salt and fresh cracked pepper. How to: Cook McCain Mashed Butternut and McCain Wedges according to package instructions. Pat dry the pork chops and season with salt and pepper. Heat a saucepan over high heat – allow the pan to get very hot and then add the oil. Cook the pork chops for about five minutes per side and remove them from the pan and allow to rest. To the same pan add the onion and allow to brown before adding the whole grain mustard, thyme, sage, paprika and garlic powder. Add the chicken stock and mix well. Allow the sauce to reduce on medium – about 5 minutes or so. Add pork chops back to the pan, cover and switch off the heat. Adjust seasoning, serve hot with mashed butternut and wedges.
