From minor cuts and grazes to stuffy noses and insect stings, a well-stocked first aid kit is super handy in the event of accidents and injuries. Many most people keep a first aid kit in their homes, you should also keep a small first aid kit in your car for emergencies. Here’s everything you need to know about what you need in your first-aid kit, storing your family’s medicine, and administering it. Incorrect storage of medications can result in rapid degradation and contamination of your medication, even before the expiry date. Remember to always store all your medicines in their original containers where the medicine’s name, batch number (important in the event of a drug recall) and expiry date are clearly visible. For example, tablets dispensed in blister packs and amber-coloured bottles need to be kept in their packaging so that they aren’t exposed to oxygen. Medicines should be kept in cool, dry conditions, away from direct sunlight, heat, and moisture, as these conditions cause medicines to break down and become less effective.
