Due to the pandemic, it’s more important than ever to view fitness holistically. This means combining fitness, nutrition, sleep and even meditation into your daily lifestyle. If you’re running yourself ragged on minimal sleep and poor nutrition, then the fitness benefits shrink. The focus must be understanding all elements of wellbeing and their impact. The importance of a fit squad is immeasurable as it’s a brilliant way to motivate and encourage each other. It’s also a great way to socialise outdoors so plan those morning jogs or walks and grab a coffee afterwards. Another benefit is that there is safety in numbers so you aren’t as vulnerable.  The meteoric rise of virtual fitness has continued well into 2021 and now you’re able to attend group, individual or even pre-recorded classes and exercise programmes from your lounge. People have realised you don’t need expensive gym contracts to move your body – you just need a device and an internet connection, a sweat towel and water. People around the world are downloading apps to keep their fitness, diet and wellbeing on track. Apps like MapMyRun, RunKeeper, MyFitnessPal, Noom are ideal to keep your goals in sight. The apps track progress over time, which works wonders for motivation especially when in sync with watch software. If gaming is more your vibe, then you’ll like this trend. The video game industry has incorporated fitness into games by using body movement as the main controller. Video games like Just Dance 2021 encourage dance in order to move up a level. Xbox and Nintendo also offer various games that double up as a fitness class. It’s such fun, you won’t even notice that you’re building up a sweat.  An added bonus is that you can connect with other players virtually. * Source: Supplied by Shower To Shower
