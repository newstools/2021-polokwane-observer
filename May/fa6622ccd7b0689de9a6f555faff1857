Don’t limit your souvlaki to Greek festivals when it is easy enough to make it yourself at home. Serves 4-6 You’ll need: McCain Oven Chips; 1kg chicken fillets cubed; 3 tablespoons olive oil; 3 cloves garlic crushed; 2 teaspoons paprika; 1 tablespoon chopped oregano; 1 tablespoon chopped thyme; 1 teaspoon chilli flakes; zest and juice of 1 lemon; salt and pepper to taste. How to: Cook McCain Oven Chips according to package instructions. Combine the cubed chicken with olive oil, garlic, paprika, oregano, thyme, chilli flakes, lemon juice and zest, salt and pepper – allow to marinate for at least an hour. Once the chicken has marinated, thread it into skewers. Heat grill pan or skillet on medium to high heat – you could also braai the chicken or roast in the oven at 200°C for 20 minutes. Grill the chicken skewers until cooked and charred, turning a few times. Serve with McCain oven chips and a green salad. * For more recipe inspiration visit mccain.co.za/retail/madewithmccain/
