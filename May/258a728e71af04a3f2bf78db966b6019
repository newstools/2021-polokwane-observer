Healthy doesn’t have to be bland! These egg muffins are loaded with all sorts of tasty goodness. Makes 12 You’ll need: 12 extra-large eggs; 125ml cream; ½ cup spring onions, chopped; 2 cloves garlic, grated; 1 chilli, diced; 1 large red bell pepper, diced; 1 cup corn, cut off the cob (or frozen); 2 cups baby spinach; 60g (½ cup) mozzarella, grated; Salt and pepper, to taste; Olive oil How to: Preheat oven to 180˚C and grease a 12 cup cupcake tin. Add a drizzle of olive oil to a large frying pan. Add spring onion, garlic and chilli. Cook until fragrant. Add bell pepper and corn and cook until tender. Add spinach and cook until wilted and all water evaporates. Remove from the heat and stir through the cheese. Meanwhile, whisk eggs and cream together. Season well. Evenly distribute the veggies into the cupcake tin. Pour egg mixture over veggies. Bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes, or until golden and set. Serve warm and enjoy! To freeze: Wrap cooked and cooled muffins tightly with cling film and place in a ziplock bag and freeze. To reheat: Defrost muffins in the fridge or covered on the counter. Oven: Place muffins on a baking tray and reheat in the oven at 180˚C until warmed through. Microwave: For a quicker breakfast on the go option use the microwave. Place on a piece of paper towel on a microwave-safe plate. Reheat gently in the microwave on medium power until hot and warmed through to the centre, about 30 seconds (from thawed) or 1 to 2 minutes (from frozen). * Recipe and image by the South African Poultry Association.
