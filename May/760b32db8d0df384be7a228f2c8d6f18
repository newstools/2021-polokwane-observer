Winter is on its way and we can already feel the chill in the air, which means playing outside today will most likely be off the cards. Don’t worry, you can keep your child busy indoors with these fun crafts. There is no end to the characters you can create with this sensory craft. When the puppets are complete, your child can enjoy playing with them in a way that boosts her confidence and engages her imagination.  Once the butterfly is completed, your child can move her hands up and down so she can see how the wings start to flap as she runs around the lounge (if you’ll allow it).  If your little one is a dinosaur fan, this craft is a must! It’s quick and easy to do and perfect for tots of about three years of age, who will love painting their creations and drawing on the faces.
