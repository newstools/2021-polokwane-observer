Efficient end-to-end management systems are vital to control daily activities and help managers reach their targets by cutting manual tasks and automating critical functions. Informed and efficient management decisions are also enabled by having access to integrated, real-time data and a centralised database at the heart of the solution. Businesses must adapt daily to unexpected market and environmental changes and to do that they need an integrated system that gives them real-time data. As a result of Covid-19, the increasing use of technology to stay connected is creating new habits around the world. If not done already, now is the time to change business operations to match these new digital expectations. Working remotely seems to be the way of the future and so is remote IT management. As a result, integrated human capital management (HCM) solutions in the cloud will become increasingly common, and performance reviews will increasingly move online as the world becomes more digital.  Document management systems and collab platforms are more popular than ever, allowing secure access to documents for remote workers from any device of their choice. Buying decisions are still taking longer and the time from lead to prospect, and from prospect to closure has had a big impact on new sales across many sectors. Businesses have had to rethink their innovation and marketing strategies. However, now that there is a vaccine rollout, perhaps people may start to feel safer and more confident about buying decisions in the future. *Source: Supplied by Seidor Africa
