The 49-year-old social worker has a passion for making an impactful change in people’s lives and is a motivational speaker as well. She explained that it is part of her job, as a social worker, to motivate people. She just took it beyond the line of duty. “I do talks everywhere I get invited to and I enjoy it thoroughly,” she said. When Koma received a prophesy through social media from someone she has never met, saying that she must write a book, she had doubts as writing was never her strongest suit. “I struggled with the message and prayed to God. I am a motivational speaker and had no interest in writing. I was convincing myself to write when I found out that four of my friends who were all in the process of writing books had stopped writing. I encouraged them to continue, as I thought that was what the prophesy rather meant,” she explained. Later, she was at a bookshop searching for a book, but couldn’t find anything that appealed to her. “I asked the Holy Spirit to show me a book because I was on leave and looking for something to read. The spirit of the Lord told me that it is time to write my own book,” she said. Mary left there with a blank book and a pen, and was slightly disappointed but she repented when she got home because she had not done what the Spirit told her to do from the start. She started writing, guided by the spirit, in 2018. The book was published in January this year and is titled Don’t look far, God is here with you. “This book is a reminder that God is the same God yesterday, today and tomorrow. I hope it encourages people to trust God, even when facing difficulties,” she added. The book is available at PNA in the Tzaneen Lifestyle Centre, and they can also be bought directly from her at 066 241 2696 or from Sir Mpho M at 061 426 8725.
