The Polokwane Municipality’s Spokesperson, Thipa Selala, has announced that the 6-hour planned water interruption by Lepelle Northern Water (LNW) has been postponed. The interruption, which will affect several areas of supply within the city, was scheduled for tomorrow (Thursday, 13 May). The date of the interruption has now been moved to Thursday, 20 May, according to a statement by Selala. LNW confirmed that on the new date, water will be turned off from 08:00 to 14:00 to allow the water team to investigate reported illegal connections along the main pipeline near Boyne. Selala said this planned shutdown will affect the municipality’s ongoing efforts to restore water supply to areas within the municipal area. Selala explained that several areas of the city have been without sufficient water supply for the past two weeks due to low reservoir levels. “Reservoir levels have been at their lowermost since last week and have shown no improvement.” At the time the original date for the shutdown was announced, Selala said most of the reservoirs were at 0% despite pumping from both LNW’s water schemes. Residents are advised to limit water consumption to immediate household needs. Report water supply issues, leaks and burst pipes to the water and sanitation helpline at 015 023 5376 / 5629.
