There are pros and cons to taking your pup to a daycare facility. On the positive side, it can help dogs with separation anxiety and keep them mentally stimulated and socialised with other dogs. It also stops them barking all day. On the other hand, doggie daycare can be overstimulating or stressful for dogs that are under socialised. There is also a risk of catching kennel cough or fleas. It’s important to do your homework on any daycare centre as some of them don’t operate as well as others. You’ll also find ones that cater for up to 50 dogs, which limits space and attention and can cause later issues. * Source: barkercise.com
