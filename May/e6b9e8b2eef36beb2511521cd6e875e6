Making a perfect soufflé need not be as daunting as you may think. Take a leaf out of Chef Mark’s recipe collection and give his sumptuous soufflé a try. Serves 10 portions You’ll need: Pastry cream – 300ml orange juice; 150ml milk; 2 eggs; 10g sugar; 25g cornflour; 25g butter. How to: Place the orange juice in a pot and bring to the boil. Cook until the liquid has reduced to a third (100ml). In a bowl, mix the eggs and cornflour together. In a separate pot, mix the milk and sugar and bring to the boil. Whisk this into the egg mix bowl. Pour the egg mix back in the pot and cook until thickened. Whisk in the butter and reduced juice. You’ll need: Soufflé – pastry cream; 60g grated white chocolate; whites of 8 eggs (egg whites should weigh 250g); 60g sugar; 10ml Grand Marnier liqueur. How to: In a bowl, mix the pastry cream and white chocolate together. In a separate bowl whisk the egg whites. When frothed up add the sugar a little at a time while whisking. Whisk until stiff peaks form. Mix a small amount of the meringue into the pastry cream and then fold in the rest of the meringue making sure you don’t over mix. Pour into a prepped ramekin and scrape off the excess on the top making sure it’s even on the top and the sides are clean. This will make sure the soufflé rises evenly. Place in an oven at 175°C for 12-15 minutes. Take out gently and enjoy!
