The 24-year-old student from Flora Park was born into a business-oriented family. Her mother and late father had a knack for business, which fueled her interest in it. She took affordability and appeal of whatever she would sell into consideration when she decided to start her own business. “I decided to make atchar, because almost everyone I know eats it. At that time, I had no clue how to make it or where to find mangoes and the existing atchar-sellers weren’t keen to share their information either,” she said. That did not discourage her. She did more research, found a mango supplier and all that was left was to come up with a flavour that would set her apart from other atchar brands on the market. “I honestly had no idea what I was doing, I just mixed spices until it actually tasted good,” she explained. Kamogelo started selling her atchar to family and church friends, then she took her business to the streets after her confidence grew from the positive feedback. “I literally took my business to the streets, selling my product at a stop sign. You need to put in the work for your business to grow, and I am willing to do exactly that,” she added. Her strategy worked, because her business is growing and she has started selling atchar to referrals. “The referrals just confirmed that I am on the right track. They proved that I can potentially have the best atchar in town,” she said. She is specific about tidiness and hygiene when making her atchar and is currently working on packaging. “I am still deciding on a name. I am taking my time because I want it to be perfect and resonate with my product,” she added. Being able to supply her atchar to other people to sell so that they can also make a living off of it is a big highlight for her. “It pushes me to grow the business even more because it helps others put bread on the table and that is heart-warming,” she concluded.
