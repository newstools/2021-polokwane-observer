There is so much to love about Groote Post Seasalter wine … the elegance and purity of fruit, the vibrant acidity,  the oyster shell minerality and saline finish, typical of Sauvignons from the maritime cool-climate Darling Hills terroir. Even the name captured the essence of the wine. Seasalter 2020  it’s a summer beach escape in a bottle. Think grapefruit and zesty lime with hints of fynbos, sea-breeze and a touch of oak. Serve it with seafood, of course. Around R150 from wine merchants or groote-post-wines.myshopify.com
