The 30-year-old is a skincare therapist with over eight years of experience in the industry. Katlego is a somatology graduate who explained that she has always known that she did not want an office job. “I love working with my hands and growing up, I used to do my sisters’ hair. It made sense to go into the beauty industry,” she said. When she initially told her parents about her career of choice, they did not completely understand why she did not choose something more conventional. “I remember they asked me why I would choose to do nails and wash people’s faces for a living,” she laughed. Katlego has over the years proved that the beauty industry is lucrative with plenty of room for growth. She is one of the best at what she does and has the awards to prove it. She made the top 20 best skincare therapists nationally, for two years in a row while she worked at Sorbet. For three years, she was the best in her local store and received cash prizes for it. Katlego decided that now is the right time for her to use her expertise towards building a legacy. “My dream is to create employment for young people who choose to get into this field. At the moment I work alone and my sister helps with the admin. I have a feeling that the business will blow up and I will need the extra hands,” she said. Katlego currently operates a mobile spa and does house calls, while she puts the finishing touches to her work space. She is overwhelmed with the love and support she receives from people seeking her services. “I am grateful to have grown to this level and I know I am not in this alone. I promise to continue to give the best and professional service you have come to expect from me. I also give value for money and leave you with an undeniable glow,” she said.
