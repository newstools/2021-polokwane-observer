Serves 12 You’ll need: For the cakes – 100g salted or unsalted butter; 120g dark chocolate (you can use Lindt 78 per cent dark chocolate); 150g castor sugar; ½ cup milk; ½ cup flour; 1/3 cup self-rising flour; 2 tbsp cocoa powder; 2 eggs; butter or non-stick cooking spray, for greasing. For the Top Deck ganache – 150g Top Deck, plus more for garnish; 3 tbsp pouring cream. How to: Preheat the oven to 160˚C. Place the butter, dark chocolate, sugar and milk into a pot and stir over low heat until melted and smooth. Pour the mixture into a bowl and sift in the flours and cocoa powder. Whisk until smooth, and then whisk in the egg. Spoon the batter into a well-greased 12-hole muffin pan and cook for 15 minutes. Allow cakes to cool slightly before removing them from the pan using a palette knife. To make the ganache, heat the cream in a pot over low heat, then add the Top Deck. When the chocolate is half-melted, remove the pot from heat and whisk the mixture until fully melted. Dollop the ganache onto the cakes. Using a vegetable peeler, shave the Top Deck sideways and scatter the shavings onto the cakes. For more recipes, visit cookstudio.co.za.
