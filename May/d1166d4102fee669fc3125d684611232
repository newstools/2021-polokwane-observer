If you’re planning on spoiling mum on Sunday the 9th (and if not, you should be), we’ve the perfect treat. Something sweet, and a glass of wine. What could be more perfect? This recipe for Vanilla French Toast serves two generously, so you can share. This is more of an afternoon treat than a breakfast spoil, so there’s no guilt in serving it with a glass of rosé. Of course, if you prefer, you can make her breakfast in bed, and keep the wine for a special lunch later in the day. You’ll need: 4 large eggs; half a cup each cream and full cream milk; 2 tablespoons sugar; 1 tablespoon vanilla paste / extract with seeds; quarter teaspoon sea salt flakes; 6 thick slices of challah or brioche; 3 Tbsp butter; ¼ cup almond flakes, toasted, to serve; Pure maple syrup, to serve; Fresh seasonal berries, to serve (Raspberries & strawberries work particularly well with the vanilla flavour in the French toast). Method: Preheat oven to 120°C. Lightly beat eggs, cream, milk, sugar, salt and vanilla in a large shallow bowl / baking dish.  Add sliced bread, turn to coat, then press down gently on bread until you feel it soak up custard mixture. Make sure bread is well soaked. Heat some of the butter in a large non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Using your largest spatula, gently transfer the bread from the custard to the pan, letting the excess drip back into the dish. Cook until golden brown on both sides. Transfer pieces of French toast to a metal cooling rack sitting on top of a baking tray and keep warm in the oven while you cook the remaining slices. Serve French toast as two stacks topped generously with toasted almonds and berries. Drizzle with plenty of maple syrup and serve with a glass of chilled FAT bastard Rosé 2020, a gorgeous salmon pink wine which smells of ripe sweet strawberries and watermelon, and tastes of fresh summer berries.
