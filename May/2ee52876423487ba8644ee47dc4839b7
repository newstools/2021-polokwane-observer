Journeys are the theme for the next Exclusive Books Cover to Cover online book show presented by Joanne Joseph who travels through countries, to navigating privilege and the journey to financial freedom with four remarkable authors. The show will feature an interview with Dr Emmanuel Taban, author of The Boy Who Never Gave Up, Shubnum Khan, author of How I Accidentally Became a Global Stock Photo, Nicolette Mashile on her book, What’s Your Move? and Norma Young on her book, We Need More Tables. Norma also reviews Untamed by Glennon Doyle and The 5am Club by Robin Sharma. ‘Books allow us the privilege of journeying into other worlds without leaving our own bodies,’ says Joanne. ‘In this show, we walk an arduous journey through Africa with former refugee, Emmanuel Taban. We soar to the Himalayas and other enchanting places with Shubnum Khan. Then we travel inward with Norma Young to explore how to navigate privilege in our needy society and journey toward personal financial freedom with Nicolette Mashile. I’m hoping these books will produce a shift in the perspectives of readers who are seeking answers and inspiration.’ ‘Reading can take you places you have never been before,’ says Batya Bricker from Exclusive Books.‘ ‘As we face another year where physical travel may prove impossible, books provide the cheapest and safest flight of fancy without leaving your home. ‘Armchair travel’ need not be confined to travel books – reading about Emmanual Taban’s incredible journey or Shubnum Kahn’s crazy adventures transport you to another place and another time.’ Tune in this coming Thursday, 6pm on the Exclusive Books YouTube channel.
