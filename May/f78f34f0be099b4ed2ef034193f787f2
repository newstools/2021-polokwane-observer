A total of 14 students’ academic year was made easier after they received laptops worth R5 000 each. The students, who are from the University of Limpopo met the requirements of having completed Gr 12 in 2020, passed with outstanding marks and come from a disadvantaged background. Students qualify regardless of race, gender and nationality if they meet the academic and social requirements. Sterward Kane, a representative from Zororo Phumulani explained that they take pride in enhancing students’ academic journey. “We are here today so that our future, the students, can have the necessary tools to excel in the field of education,” he said. He encouraged the students to use the laptops wisely to elevate themselves educationally. University of Limpopo Vice-chancellor, Professor Mahlo Mokgalong, said initiatives such as these need to be mentioned because donors they go out of their way to assist students. “In the past, you could go through university without a laptop but these days, you might as well forget about being successful. “With the Covid-19 pandemic and the way universities are operating, a laptop is a must. For Zororo Phumulani to assist students is greatly appreciated,” he said. He urged other business to come on board assisting students with their various needs to successfully complete their higher education.
