Are you travelling abroad with your baby? Here are a few things to keep in mind: It’s the absolute worst knowing all your child wants to do is drink milk and you just don’t have enough to feed them. To be safe, pack triple the amount of formula you think you may need. We also recommend packing formula into all your various luggage pieces in case it gets separated from any of your luggage. On long flights, your baby will get getting grumpier by the minute if their nappy is dirty. Always keep a nappy bag at your feet so you can change your baby on your lap if there is a real bowel emergency and the toilet cubicle is occupied! Pack snacks ahead of your flight, your baby’s favourite toys (a rattle, a bunny, a car and a peek-a-boo toy), and books to read to him. Adding activity sticker books for toddlers is also a great way to keep them entertained.  Also, just for backup, make sure your phone is fully charged so older kids can play games on them.
