If you ask any parent, they’ll probably admit that homemade gifts from the heart are more special for a birthday than any expensive item you’ll find in a store. What’s more, sitting and making the gift with your child will provide the opportunity for some quality time with mom, dad, and granny, too! Help your child surprise a parent, a friend, or a family member with one of these special, yet simple, gifts. This homemade gift idea is simple to make, yet practical because it can be used to store pencils, keys, or spare coins. There’s no doubt that your little one will love making their very own lion mask card. Download your card template here. We love this sentimental gift box idea from US-based mommy blogger Darcy. She started the blog, Darcy and Brian with her husband to document her pregnancy and parenting journey as a mom of two. This box makes a great gift on its own, or you could fill it with something else such as chocolates.
