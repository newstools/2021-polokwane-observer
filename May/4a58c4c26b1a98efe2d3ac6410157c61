Expected at the courts are 18 volleyball teams from five districts in the province. Communications Manager for the Association, Zonaka Tshivhase said the teams and the players are happy to resume with the league matches after a year without competitive games. “The games will take place after more than a year without volleyball activities in the province due to Covid-19. We are expecting bumper action and good matches from the teams. The players have been itching to get to the field of play and they cannot wait for the event.” He also added that during the opening games they will select players who will represent the province at the National Volleyball League set to commence in September. “We were asked by the National Volleyball League committee to come up with a team that will represent the province at the national league and we will use the platform to put the team together. We want to select a formidable team that will win us tough matches and silverware. The province boasts with vast volleyball talent and I think we will come with a good team. We are looking for players with good behaviour, discipline, game skills and work ethic,” Tshivhase said.
