The market will surely give locals something to do on weekends. The market, which is open on Saturday and Sunday is the perfect opportunity to catch up on socialising and shopping. “Polokwane does not have to be boring anymore. For some reason, Sundays in Polokwane is quiet and I do not want to cook for myself on Sunday. I want someone else to cook for me and spend time with my family,” market organiser, Michael Landman said. For their opening weekend, the market had 60 vendors providing a range of products. Michael explained that the market is set to become a social hub for Polokwane. “During the day, people can come to do their shopping and for those who prefer to come later in the day, they are more than welcome,” he said. Landman added that another thing that sets them apart from other markets is that they have a wide variety of food options available. New vendors are also welcome to exhibit at the market and their first exhibition is free so they can see if the market fits their target market. They can contact Michael at 084 921 5488.
