An operator/agent is POPI’s right hand. They process your personal information for the agreed upon transaction you engaged in. Their main job is to collect and process data according to precise instructions in terms of a written contract. An agent should also be adequately authorised to be in this position to avoid a serious breach of the Protection of Personal Information Act (POPI) 4 of 2013. They have very specific and tailored contracts ensuring confidentiality and strict measures when dealing with your information. They are merely service providers who processes and has to discard your information when it is not used anymore. They are placed under strict conditions not to use your data for their personal agendas.  That means an operator must identify and ensure safeguards concerning all risks surrounding the collecting, processing, and storing of data; regularly monitor that all procedures are being applied correctly and continuously update all safeguards in light of any new risks that may be identified. In the event of a data breach, the operator will swiftly and promptly react by alerting the necessary authorities and you, of course in order for defensive steps to be taken if necessary.
