The 21-year-old is the founder of Love at first bite, a baking business that she started in August last year. Annita started baking at the age of 15 and is self-taught. Over the years, she learned as much as she can about her passion until she felt she was ready to take it to the next level and start a business. “I decided to call my business Love at first bite because everybody who tastes my treats loves them from the very first bite,” she said. The idea to turn her passion into a business was inspired by seeing how the chefs she follows on social media use the platforms to market their services and she decided to follow suit. One of the challenges that she encountered as a small business owner was when people changed their orders after she has already bought the ingredients, but she resolved the problem by insisting on a deposit to confirm a client’s order. Annita is happy with the feedback and referrals that she is getting from her clients and sees it as proof that she is on the right track. “I am humbled by the love that I am receiving and it pushes me to do better and to broaden my expertise,” she said. She added, however, that the world of business is for the brave-hearted, as it challenges you every day. “Sometimes you will feel like quitting but that is not an option, you need to soldier on until you realise your dreams. Do not pursue a business idea unless you are passionate and committed to seeing it through,” she said. She plans to one day own a coffee shop in town where she can be creative with her treats and give people a taste of Love at first bite.
