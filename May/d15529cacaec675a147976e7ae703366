If you’re suffering from a cold or flu, there is literally nothing nicer than a giant bowl of soothing chicken broth. Rich in vitamins and minerals and filled with goodness from the bones and vegetables, it also keeps you hydrated and can even help with nasal congestion. Plus it’s good for gut and skin health and helps your joints as collagen does. You’ll need: 1 cooked chicken carcass; 1 large onion, roughly chopped; 2 carrots, peeled and chopped; 2 celery stalks, roughly chopped; 1 bay leaf; 2 good-quality vegetable stock cubes; 940ml water To finish the broth: 2 carrots, peeled and sliced; 2 spring onions, finely chopped; 2 celery stalks, finely chopped; salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste; fresh parsley, chopped, to serve. How to: To make the stock, remove and shred the leftover bits of chicken from the carcass. Cover and refrigerate. Put the carcass and the chopped vegetables into a pot, add the stock cubes and enough water to cover the chicken. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for about two hours, skimming any fat off the surface. Remove the stock from the heat and strain it through a sieve so that you are left with a liquid broth. Discard the vegetables and bay leaf. Put the broth and second lot of vegetables into a pot and simmer on low heat for about an hour. Add the shredded chicken to your broth about 10 minutes before it’s ready. Season and sprinkle with parsley. Serve in lovely big soup bowls or mugs.
