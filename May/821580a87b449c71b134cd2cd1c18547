The Capricorn district male netball team beat the team of Ekurhuleni 49-47 to become the champions of the National Males Netball Championship during the final match recently held at Sun City. On their way to the finals they eliminated Sekhukhune, Johannesburg and Kenneth Kaunda netball clubs. The team’s assistant coach, Emily Mathosa said the team played five matches, of which they won and lost one game during the round robin matches. She said that they could not have achieved the accolade if it was not for the hard work they put in during the off season. “We started preparing for the championships last year. As the assistant coach, I enjoyed working with the players. It has been a great week and with great results at the end of the tournament,” Mathosa said. “We are truly proud of the team and the manner in which they conducted themselves. The team spirit was great, apart from the one game we lost; I will still say it was a successful tournament with minimal challenges. A great learning experience for the new players, management and excellent opportunity to be part of the team. All I wish is that the team can get sponsors for the national tournament in September and in the future,” Mathosa concluded.
