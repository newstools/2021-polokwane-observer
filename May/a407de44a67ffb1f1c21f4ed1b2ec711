Did you know that it is against the law to transport children under the age of three without securing them in a car seat? Six years ago, on May 1, 2015, a new regulation to the National Road Traffic Act came into effect enforcing the use of car seats for children. Anyone who does not follow this rule will be fined heavily in an effort to reduce fatal accidents on the roads, especially during the holiday season. According to Arrive Alive Research Data and Statistics, properly installed and used child safety car seats for children aged newborn to four years can reduce the risk of death by 70%. These six guidelines will assist you in selecting the best car seat for your child: The majority of infant car seats include a plastic base that you install in your vehicle. When you’re ready to go, you snap the seat into the base and buckle up your child. You simply unclip the car seat from the base and take it with you when you arrive at your destination. Some people purchase a second base to keep in a backup vehicle. The straps are more adjustable (and thus safer) than older designs, with one for each shoulder, one for each thigh, and one between your baby’s legs. As your child grows, you’ll need to adjust the harness, so steer clear of seats that make this difficult. You can easily adjust the straps and harness height from the front of a better car seat. A few models even have quick-release buckles that can be adjusted with one hand. Babies and messes go hand in hand, but a surprising number of car seats come with hard-to-remove covers. Cleaning up is a breeze thanks to a detachable, machine-washable cover. A well-padded seat with plenty of head support provides a safer and more comfortable ride for your baby. Some car seats have energy-absorbing foam and other features that help protect your baby’s head and chest in the event of a side-impact collision.
