You’ll need: Some empty, washed cans with a few holes made in the bottom; string/ twine/ ribbon; pebbles (store-bought or from the garden); moss (real moss available at your Garden Centre or visit your local craft shop for fake moss sheets); arts and crafts accessories you have lying around; super glue or double-sided tape.  How to: Start by thinking about which cans will be for outdoor and indoor decoration to determine which décor accessories would work best. Have a look at all your goodies and think about the theme/ colour scheme you’re going for to spice up your chosen area. Use the superglue or double-sided tape to secure your string/ twine/ ribbon around the can. If you are using pebbles or shells, pop them on too with some superglue. Add a little texture to your can by tying a different piece of string/twine/ribbon around it. This will also help to keep your design together.  Décor tip: You could always decorate half of the can one way, and the rest with a different accessory. For example, try decorating the base of the can with pebbles or shells, and the top half with moss or twine. This will give you added texture and bonus points for creativity!
