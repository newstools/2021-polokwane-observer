We have already established who needs to make sure they become best friends with POPI, how she affects you and what she protects. But, is there any exceptions when it comes to her and the Act? The accountability rests with the “responsible party”, which the Government Gazette defines as “a public or private body or any other person which, alone or in conjunction with others, determines the purpose of and means for processing personal information”. The Gazette also states that processing of personal information is not in breach of a condition for the processing of such information if the The Gazette adds that the Regulator may, by notice in the Gazette, “grant an exemption to a responsible party to process personal information, even if that processing is in breach of a condition for the processing of such information”.
