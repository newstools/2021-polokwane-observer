You need: a glass jar, citrus peel and rind including the pith and membranes, white vinegar, fresh herbs and a spray bottle. Method: Submerge citrus peels in a little vinegar into a glass jar each day. Add fresh mint, rosemary, thyme or sage if you like. Once the jar is filled, leave it at room temperature to soak for at least a week, giving it a shake now and then. When ready, strain the mixture twice through a fine sieve and pour it into a spray bottle. * Source: homesteadandchill.com
