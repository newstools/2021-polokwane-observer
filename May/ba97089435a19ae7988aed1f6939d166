Mothers and their children could choose from a 7 km, 14 km or 21 km walk starting from the Seshego Circle Centre. Participants who registered before the day received a bucket hat and were dressed to the all black and colourful socks theme. Event coordinator, Violet Mahlangu says because of Covid-19 an outdoor event was the safer option for everyone. “As a fitness fanatic I wanted mothers and their children to be able to spend some time outdoors and feel the exhilaration of completing a challenge while also advocating a healthy lifestyle.” She says that #WeRunKasi was started in 2019, due to a lack of running clubs in Seshego. “Some of our runners here, actually form part of clubs in the city due to the unavailability of a club here. The proceeds from today’s fun walk will be used to officiate the club by registering it with the relevant authority. We currently have more than 30 people who are part of the club.” A total of 135 people registered for the walk but more eventually joined. “The aim is to have people running or walking and we did just that.” The participants enjoyed a session of aerobics after the walk.
