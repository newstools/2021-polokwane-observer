It’s an isometric core strength exercise that involves maintaining a position similar to a push up for the maximum time possible (Wikipedia). Start with a 10 to 15 second plank and build your time up by five seconds every day and see if you can reach the two minute mark. Even doing a one-minute plank every day is beneficial. The longest plank is said to have been held for over four hours.
