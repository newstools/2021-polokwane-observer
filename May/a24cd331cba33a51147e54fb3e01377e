Lepelle Northern Water (LNW) has announced a 6-hour planned water interruption, which will affect several areas of supply within the city on Thursday, 13 May. LNW confirmed that water will be turned off from 08:00 to 14:00 to allow the water team to investigate reported illegal connections along the main pipeline near Boyne. According to the spokesperson for the Polokwane Municipality, Thipa Selala this planned shutdown will affect the municipality’s ongoing efforts to restore water supply to areas within the municipal area. Selala explained that several areas of the city have been without sufficient water supply for the past two weeks due to low reservoir levels. “Reservoir levels have been at their lowermost since last week and have shown no improvement. As of this morning, most of the reservoirs are at 0% despite pumping from both LNW’s water schemes.” The municpality advised residents to limit water consumption to immediate household needs and to report water supply issues, leaks and burst pipes to the water and sanitation helpline at 015 023 5376 / 5629.
