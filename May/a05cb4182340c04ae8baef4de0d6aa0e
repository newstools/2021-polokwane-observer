Noordelikes head coach, Frederick Romijn said all the players are looking forward to their first match and the start of the league. The league was halted last year in March due to Covid-19. “All the players are excited to finally be back and play competitive matches. They have been training in groups and working hard during these training sessions, preparing for the encounter. We are looking forward to an exciting match against Letaba,” Romijn said. Noordelikes’ outside centre, Donovan Suddes said they are expecting a tough match against Letaba. “Our win rate against them is quite good. They pose a huge threat when we are playing on their home ground but we always win against them when we play on our home turf. However, we are looking forward to a great match which I think we will win.”
