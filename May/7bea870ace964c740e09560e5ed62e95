If you thought biltong is only an on-the-go snack, you’re completely wrong. Jazz up a classic quiche with butternut and yes … you’ve guessed it. Biltong! Serves 4 You’ll need: 3 sheets phyllo pastry; olive oil spray; 80ml cooked, caramelized onion; 300g honey; roasted butternut wedges; 80g crumbled feta cheese; 80ml low-fat sour cream; 1 egg; 80g thinly sliced biltong (use lean biltong); fresh basil for serving How to Preheat the oven to 180°C. Lay a sheet of phyllo pastry on the work surface. Spray with olive oil, top with the second sheet and spray with olive oil. Do the same with the third sheet of phyllo pastry. Cut the layered sheets in half and place them on top of one another. Line a greased rectangular quiche dish with the pastry sheets – cut off any excess pastry with scissors. Mix the egg and soured cream together and spread on the pastry. Top with caramelized onion, butternut and feta cheese. Bake in the oven for about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven, cool slightly and top with the biltong slices and fresh basil. Recipe by Christine Capendale. Image by Anita Reed, Disney Channel.
