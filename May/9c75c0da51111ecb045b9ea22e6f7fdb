Maduma, represented South Africa at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and also boasts national and international coaching experience. He coached the Bangladesh national team for a year and led them to 11 medals at the South Asian Games in 2019. Kakata Maponyane, Director of Sports Administration and Recreation at UL said Maduma’s experience will benefit the university in their quest of producing provincial and national fencers. “We had fencing at the university in the past years but it was not successful. With the re-introduction of the sporting code we are hoping to produce provincial and national gold medalists. “We have 27 students in our club and they are excited to be part of this new venture. They have started training for the upcoming events.” According to Renuka Ramroop, a research associate in education at UL and chairperson for the Limpopo Fencing Association, fencing would serve as a springboard for the university and the association to provide learners from nearby areas with the opportunity to engage in the sport and bring it to underserved communities. “We encourage both students and staff to participate in this incredible sport because it has something for everyone. Followers of sports at UL will get to witness fencing, an Olympic sport, at the institution’s sport facilities. The developmental sport was launched in partnership with the Limpopo Fencing Association.”
