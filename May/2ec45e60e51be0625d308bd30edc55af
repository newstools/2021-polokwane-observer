How to: Pour 10ml olive oil into a small saucepan and add garlic. Fry for a minute. Add the chopped red onion and cook at a gentle heat for a few minutes until onions are soft. Add the tomato paste, chopped tomato and season with a little salt and pepper. Then add the honey. Cook the sauce (with the lid on the saucepan) for five minutes on low heat. Remove from the heat and add cream/ yoghurt. Heat 5ml olive oil in a frying pan and add cherry tomatoes. Cook them until they burst and turn golden at the edges. Season with salt & pepper.
