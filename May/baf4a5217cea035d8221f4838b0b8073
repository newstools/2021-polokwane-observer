Serves 12 You’ll need: 200g digestive biscuits; 135g butter; 200g milk or dark chocolate; 2 – 3 Tbsp golden syrup; 100g mini marshmallows; 100g each of other sweets of your choice, nuts (optional) and raisins (optional); 100g honeycomb, broken into pieces. How to: Grease an 18cm square baking tin and line it with baking paper. Put the digestive biscuits into a sealed plastic bag and bash with a rolling pin or the side of your fist until they resemble dust ( a few small lumps is fine). Melt the butter, chocolate and syrup over low heat, stirring until there are no lumps. Remove and set aside. Put the crushed biscuits, marshmallows, other sweets, honeycomb and any other ingredients you’ve chosen and stir them into the chocolate mixture. Place the mixture into the tin and chill in the fridge for at least two hours before cutting into pieces. * Recipe source: bbcfood.co.uk
