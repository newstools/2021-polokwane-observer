POLOKWANE – POPI is the child of the president and government and was officially delivered on 19 November 2013 and published in the Government Gazette Notice 37067 on 26 November 2013. POPI’s full name is Protection of Personal Information Act 4 of 2013. That is a mouthful and we, with the help of the First Technology Group, would like to simplify things and ensure that you, your loved ones and your company, get all the information you need. In short, POPI sets some rules for responsible parties (or controllers) on how they can lawfully process the personal information of data subjects, which includes natural and juristic persons. According to government, POPI is there to promote the protection of personal information processed by public and private bodies and to establish an Information Regulator who will exercise certain powers and perform certain duties and functions. POPI knows that everyone has a right to privacy as stated in Section 14 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996. The right to privacy includes a right to protection against the unlawful collection, retention, dissemination and use of personal information. The State must therefore respect, protect, promote and fulfil the rights in the Bill of Rights. POPI knows there is a need for economic and social progress, within the framework of the information society, and therefore requires the removal of unnecessary obstructions to the free flow of information. POPI wants to ensure that she regulates the processing of your personal information, in harmony with international standards. POPI will do this in a manner that protects your right to privacy subject to justifiable limitations that are aimed at protecting other rights and important interests.  Make sure to read our next story about POPI, where we explain the rights, you have.
