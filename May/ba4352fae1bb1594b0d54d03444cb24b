The J-Bay Men’s Open may have been cancelled this year due to the pandemic, but the coastal town is still a holiday paradise for surfers and their families. Subertubes Guest House is located just 30 meters from the world-famous beach and offers visitors luxury or standard rooms with a full breakfast buffet every morning. Or there’s the self-catering apartments, which sleeps up to 10 people. Aside from riding the waves, you can go whale watching, kite surfing and sand boarding, or even enjoy a romantic horse ride on the beach. Of course, no visit to J-Bay is complete without a stop at the Walskipper for a seafood platter.
