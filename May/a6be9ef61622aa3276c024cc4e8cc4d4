Comprehensive Healthcare refers to Primary Healthcare services and includes inter alia periodic clinical assessments of all residents, clinical support services in your own home such as post-operation care, wound care and medication administration, 24-hour emergency assistance, occasional nurse-based clinic services for preventative care and routine monitoring of chronic diseases or minor illnesses. Another thing to look for is if there is a frail care facility, assisted living units and/ or home care services where qualified staff attend to you in your familiar environment. Note that this service is usually for the resident/ patient’s account but some medical schemes do pay partially or fully for this service. Just a note of caution – most medical schemes do not have benefits for the care of frail persons and this cost in a frail care facility will be for the resident/patient’s account. It is therefore important to make sure the relevant retirement village’s financial model makes provision for the subsidising of healthcare services in the retirement village to ensure affordability for the residents in the long term. Different retirement villages focus on different market segments, so they can’t have all services available. It is therefore crucial that every person establishes what their circumstances, expectations and monetary abilities are before choosing a retirement village. Ask the necessary questions ensuring your decision is an informed one! Details: Email info@medwell.co.za or visit www.medwell.co.za.
