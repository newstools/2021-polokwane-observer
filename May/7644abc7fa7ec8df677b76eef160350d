Provincial players, as well as players from Cape Town, Nelson Mandela Bay, Gauteng and Mpumalanga will take part in The Walking Football for Health Organisation in Limpopo’s tournament, which is aimed at advocating a healthy lifestyle among elderly persons. The organisation’s secretary, Steve Tabane, said they will have various teams, male and female, made up of persons older than 60. “We advocate for longevity and a healthy lifestyle among our senior citizens. We realised that most of our senior citizens, who are on pension, are not physically active. The objective is to minimise chronic illnesses among the non-exercising members of the community. Football is a universal sporting code and something we feel they could relate to. We look forward to an exciting tournament,” he explained. Tabane said they would have loved to have spectators, but due to the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic, they will not be allowed at the venue. Tabane stated that they plan to invite three provincial soccer league clubs, Baroka FC, Black Leopards and Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila. “We want them to come and observe what we are doing. Some of the players do not have playing apparel, soccer balls and training equipment and we would like for them to assist us in this regard.”
