Get rid of expired medicines, bath and beauty products you don’t use and nail polishes you don’t like. Then look at your multiples: you seriously don’t need four pairs of tweezers. And if you once bought a beauty or spa appliance such as a foot bath, and it’s just collecting dust, get rid of it. Old towels must go too.
