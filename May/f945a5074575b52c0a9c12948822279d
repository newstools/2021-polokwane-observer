Kaching is a fabulous app that uses Patented License Recognition (PLR) technology to open the boom when you arrive and leave a parking lot – what a pleasure. You simply sign up, securely link your credit card and it automatically deducts the fee from your credit card. You don’t need cash or a ticket so it’s safe and convenient.
