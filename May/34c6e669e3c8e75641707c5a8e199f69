Kibi Josias Lebogo (34) on Monday appeared in the Polokwane Magistrate’s Court for the murder of his former partner, Tshepo Rakoma (32). Lebogo was arrested on the murder scene after he threatened to jump from the roof of a building on the corner of Grobler and Landdros Maré streets where Tshepo’s body was found last Thursday. She had been shot while sitting in a vehicle on the rooftop. In a statement issued late Thursday evening, the police confirmed one person was shot and killed during the incident. According to the Director of Public Prosecutions’ Regional Spokesperson, Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi, the suspect faces charges of murder, as well as the unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition. “The matter was postponed to 18 May for further investigation and a formal bail application. “ The Women Taking Back Safety Organisation has vowed to stand in solidarity with the Rakoma family and to assist them in ensuring that justice is served. Founding member, Thulamsindo Rapotu said the organisation was disturbed by the actions of the suspects especially as they are trying to encourage women to reclaim their position in society without the fear of men. “As a mother I cannot imagine someone taking my daughter’s life and getting away with it. Our mandate in this situation is to ensure that the family gets justice although it will not bring back the life lost.” The Chairperson of the Seshego Community Against Drugs and Gangsterism, Vincent Kunutu, said they are disappointed that so soon after the men’s dialogue on GBV was held in Seshego, an incident such as this murder could happen. “One of the main issues we tried to stress at the dialogue a month ago is that there are other ways to solve issues within a relationship. Violence is never an answer. I know there were some cracks in their relationship but we did not know he was violent and that does not excuse his behaviour.” Bail application is set for 18 May.
