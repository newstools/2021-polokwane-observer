The five-year-old pageant queen was crowned as the Little Miss Diamond 2021 winner on Saturday, 1 May. Apart from obtaining the title, she was also awarded the ‘Most Photogenic’, ‘Public Choice’ in her age group, ‘Public Choice’ overall, ‘Beauty with Purpose’ and ‘Girl Boss’ titles. This was Mohau’s first pageant as she only started going to a pageant school at the beginning of this year. Her mother, Katlego explained that people would always ask her why she was not doing pageants but she never really entertained it until Mohau herself started showing interest. “She is a natural in front of the camera. She transforms into this pro and she wasn’t taught how to pose,’ she boasted. Mohau goes to Limpopo Beauty Modelling Academy, which has helped her hone her skills. Her father, Silas Mogadi, explained that it is important for them to support their child’s dreams from a young age. When Mohau is not preparing for pageants, she likes to swim and dance. Her parents added that should she one day wake up and decide that she would like to focus her attention elsewhere, they will gladly support her, however, the plan is to continue with pageants for now. “Whatever the child is capable of, even if you don’t like it, support them because you don’t know where it will lead,” she concluded.
