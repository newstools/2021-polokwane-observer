Lepelle Northern Water (LNW) has announced a 12-hour water supply interruption to take place this weekend. The shutdown is due to a planned electricity supply shutdown “by Greater Tzaneen Municipality” and according to LNW the downtime will affect all areas of supply. “The Ebenezer plant will not be operational during the shutdown period, therefore there will be a disruption in water supply to the Polokwane municipal area,” reads a letter issued to the Polokwane Municipality by LNW. Municipal Spokesperson, Thipa Selala says the shutdown will commence on Sunday, 23 May between 06:00 and 18:00. Areas to be affected include Segwashi, Boyne, Mentz and Mankweng to Polokwane and Seshego. He added that the planned water shutdown which was scheduled to commence today (Thursday, 20 May) has been put on hold until further notice. The water utility had planned to disrupt water supply to the Polokwane Municipality to allow the water team to investigate reported illegal connections along the main pipeline near Boyne. Residents are still advised to limit water consumption to immediate household needs. Report water supply issues, leaks and burst pipes to the water and sanitation helpline at 015 023 5376 / 5629.
