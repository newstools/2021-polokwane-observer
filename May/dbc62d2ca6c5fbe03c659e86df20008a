The Protection of Personal Information Act (POPI) 4 of 2013 will ensure that you have an easier time processing data, keeping what is relevant to you and destroying what you do not need. It will bring your customers piece of mind knowing that if you are compliant with POPI and FICA regulations, their personal information that are not needed after the transaction is completed will be redacted or destroyed. Clients and prospective clients should be happy and eager to do business with you, if you can prove you are POPI compliant and thus keep them and their information safe. It is easy to prove that you are POPI compliant too! You just have to maintain an open and honest relationship with them, starting by showing them that you comply with the act and by always stating the exact reason for collecting their data. Explain to them what information you are collecting, why you are collecting it and provide the business’ name and address for accountability. The client should also be reminded that they do have the right to deny participation on their behalf. The client also has the right to request for their information to be updated, rectified or deleted at any time. POPI applies to small, medium and large businesses, which means that everyone will be held accountable by the standard.
