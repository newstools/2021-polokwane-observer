Serves 4-6 You’ll need: 2 yellow peppers, cut into chunks; 1 butternut, cut into chunks; 2 courgettes, thickly sliced; 1 aubergine, cut into chunks; Royco Roasted Veggie Bake; 1 onion, chopped; 15ml oregano (5ml dried); 2 tins chopped tomatoes; 3ml salt and pepper; 3ml sugar; 100g feta; 1 egg, beaten; Royco Chicken ala King Cook-in-Sauce 415g. How to: Preheat the oven to 200°C. Follow the packet instructions to roast the yellow peppers, butternut, courgettes and aubergines with the Roasted Veggie Bake. Fry the onions and oregano in oil until soft, add the tomatoes, simmer for four minutes then season with salt, pepper and sugar. Mix the roasted vegetables and the tomato sauce together. Crumble in the feta and place in an ovenproof dish. Press down lightly to compact. Mix the egg and Chicken a la King Sauce together. Pour over the vegetables. Bake for 20-25 minutes.
