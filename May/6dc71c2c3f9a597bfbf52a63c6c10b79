This Friday we’re keeping things tart with the bittersweet taste of ruby red grapefruit. Made with grapefruit handpicked on the sun-drenched French island of Corsica in the Med, Pampelle is all citrus peel-fresh, with a touch of herbs, and makes the most amazing spitzer. Pour two tots on Pampelle into an icy cold glass, add about 75ml of Prosecco or sparkling wine, and top with soda water. Around R399 from your local bottlestore.
