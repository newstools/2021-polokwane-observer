Businesses and players may still reserve sponsorships or enter the competition until Monday. The competition will be played in a four ball alliance scramble drive format and great prizes will be up for grabs. The main attractions will be a brand-new golf cart for a hole in one on the 8th hole and the first prize, a weekend at San Lameer. Naas Vorster, President of the Rotary Club invites businesspeople and golfers to support this worthy cause of which the proceeds will go to Our Home/Ons Tuiste. “We could not host our regular fundraising events due to the Covid-19 restrictions and had to rely on down scaled projects to raise money for our charities and appeal to our regular supporters to come to the party despite the tough economic constraints,” he said. Entry fees for a four ball team are R3 000 and includes lunch and refreshments at the prize giving event. A four ball entry plus a hole sponsorship will cost R4 500, while fairway sponsorships are available at a minimum of R500. “Support us and display your banners and advertising material,” coordinator, Orrie Baragwanath said and reminded sponsors that advertising expenses are tax deductable. “You can also make a donation and claim CSI points and we will donate the money to a local crèche that the Rotary supports,” he added. Bookings and donations may still be made. Contact Lara Kirkpatrick at 082 677 2523 or Baragwanath at 083 310 2870 to reserve entries or to sponsor.
