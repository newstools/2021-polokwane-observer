As winter draws near, most of us dread the dry flaky skin, red nose, multiple layers of clothes and discomfort that the cold might bring. In the past, pre-covid, we were concerned about the flu virus in winter – how to protect the elderly and vulnerable which was mostly considered ‘the other people’ and not ourselves. Last year, there was barely a flu season! What are the possible reasons? Lockdown with less social contact, wearing of masks, staying home when you have any symptoms indicative of covid (which happen to overlap a lot with flu), more people getting the flu vaccine or not going to the doctor in fear of being infected and therefore not being diagnosed at all? It is probably a combination of all of these factors. It is important to distinguish between the common cold, flu, covid and allergies. Many symptoms overlap unfortunately. If in doubt, check it out. By knowing the difference between these conditions, the correct and timely intervention can prevent serious complications. Mild flu symptoms and the common cold can easily be treated by over-the-counter medication provided by your pharmacist. If you are a chronic allergy sufferer, you will be well aware if the allergens usually causing your symptoms are relevant and when your symptoms typically start. If you suspect you are infected by the coronavirus, do the right thing. Get tested and isolate as soon as possible! Details: www.medwell.co.za or info@medwell.co.za
