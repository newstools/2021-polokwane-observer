The theme of the event was “The Sixties” and the Rotarians made an effort to dress in their long forgotten bell bottoms and wet look attire while in-house disc jockey, Kippy Fowlds provided an impressive ambiance with music and songs from a wide selection of vinyls. The Rotarians and Anns arrived at the clubhouse at the Polokwane Bowls Club at sunset and after a short meeting to deal with club matters, guests took their seats at the colourful tables and a Thai soup starter prepared by Rotarian, Bok van Kraayenburg was served. The main course was chicken à la king made in a real sixties style by Rotarian Bruce Phillips, who also baked the traditional chocolate cake as a dessert. “Tonight, our always-hard-working ladies could sit back and be treated by the men and they surely enjoyed the fellowship,” President Naas Vorster said and thanked the members for their efforts.
