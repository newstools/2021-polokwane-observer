In only a few days, the Protection of Personal Information Act 4 of 2013 comes into effect. Sections 2 to 38, sections 55 to 109, section 111, and section 114 (1), (2) and (3) already came into effect on 1 July 2020, while sections 110 and 114(4) shall commence on 30 June 2021. What this means is that although the commencement date is fast approaching, you still have time to make sure that you comply with the act. It is best to start as soon as possible to check whether you and/or your company comply with the act. To recap, POPI sets some rules for responsible parties (or controllers) on how they can lawfully process the personal information of data subjects, which includes natural and juristic persons. Most organisations and companies should comply with the act, however, there are some exceptions which you can read about here: Do you really need to know POPI? You need to put certain things into place. You have to create an information policy and make sure that your employees know about POPI and what she entails. It is also important to appoint an information officer. We know this is a lot of information to process (pun intended), but First Technology is there to help.
