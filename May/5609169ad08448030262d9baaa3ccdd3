LIC has been operating at the Peter Mokaba Stadium for several years and according to Chief Executive Officer, Tommy Phiri the move will enable them to sell cricket to the world. “We moved to the cricket club on 1 April and it is a strategic position for us. It was a burden to sell the product at the old premises. You would want to sell the product where it is manufactured. “It would sell better where the masses would want to gather. From an expenditure point of view it was the best decision,” Phiri said. He also added that they are planning to build a 2 000 m2 indoor cricket centre in the area. “We want to be at the Polokwane Cricket Club for a long time, so the indoor centre forms part of our intentions to occupy the space forever. The centre will create jobs and there will be more parking for the players.”
