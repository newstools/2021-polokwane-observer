“Fintech’s PayCurve recently indicated that nearly 80 per cent of South Africans take out expensive, unsecured loans to service their monthly obligations.  With the rising cost of electricity and fuel, as well as the ever-present risk of load shedding, we need to find innovative ways to reduce pressure on our resources and save money,” says Susan Steward from Budget Insurance. “The changes we can make at our homes, businesses and on the road may seem insignificant, but could amount to thousands in savings per year.” With a few minor adjustments to your driving habits and with regular car maintenance, you can boost the fuel efficiency of your car by as much as 40 per cent. So, if you fill up 48 times a year at roughly R900 per tank, a 40 per cent reduction in fuel consumption could save you over R17 000 a year!
