This comes after complaints of a car-jamming syndicate were made public on social media from two residents who alleged to have been victims in the parking area of the mall. Mall management says it was also made aware of the social media posts and tried to contact the person but failed. In the post, the victim says that she was unable to use her car remote a couple of times until she noticed a foreign magnetic object on her car. When she removed the foreign object she says she was then able to unlock her car. The management at the mall says when clients are faced with obstacles at the mall, they should feel free to contact them and a team form the security department will be dispatched to assist. “If we had been alerted of this while the woman was still on the premises we would have been able to deal with the issue right then and there. “One of the major challenges we have is that people do not report incidents and then we are left in the dark. Management is here to ensure a convenient and safe shopping experience.” Another resident who opted to remain anonymous says he was the victim of a remote jamming incident at the parking area. He says that as he was walking away from the car he noticed that his remote control was not working and he had to manually lock the car. “This usually happens if someone is long pressing their gate or garage remote which jams the signal of the car remote. I did not report the matter though because I felt that it was something that could have happened anywhere.” According to mall management, they have a very good working relationship with the local police. They have urged shoppers to forward any complaints or suggestions to their office or via telephone at (015) 590 0388.
