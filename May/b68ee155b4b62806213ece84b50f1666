Chairman of Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila Football Club, Abram Sello handed over a framed memorabilia of a Nedbank Cup final jersey to Limpopo Premier, Chupu Mathabatha during a short ceremony last week. According to club’s Liaison Manager, Rufus Matsena, the gesture was a way of thanking and acknowledging the Premier. “This was our way of saying thank you to the Premier for the support he has shown to us during the Nedbank Cup.” Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandi became the second professional soccer team from the province to win major Premier Soccer League silverware. The Polokwane-based outfit wrote their names in the football history books when they beat their nemesis Chippa United Football Club 1-0 in the final of the Nedbank Cup. They emulated Baroka Football Club who won the Telkom Knockout Cup in 2018.
