Musa Appreciate Makamu is from Ivy Park and his talent has gained recognition across the country with his catchy music. He has been making music for the past seven years and he recalled that despite the waves that he is making, he produced his first song at the age of 14 years. “I completed my first and official song with a friend who goes by the name of Fuego at the age of 16 years. The trap EP (five song album) can be downloaded on Audiomack and Soundcloud,” he said. He said that it was inspired by musicians like Chris Brown and Bryson Tiller, among others, who were already in the game. Today, he has made a name for himself and is continuing to make his dreams a reality. He shared that it still has not registered with him that he has become a public figure and he has maintained a somewhat normal lifestyle. Musa Keys is not signed by any record label. Some of the challenges that he has encountered is that in the music industry there are gate keepers who will try to keep you away, and some people will only want to work with you when it is beneficial to them. “There are some gigs you cannot get because you do not want to pay accordingly or even sign a contract, there are also many other things I would not disclose,” he said. With the growth and the love that his music is receiving, he expressed that he does not feel any pressure yet to be an example to other young artists from Limpopo, although he does have people seeking advice from him. He has a new song out, Vula Mlomo which he said is receiving a lot of love and support. “The stats are going super well and I believe it will be a very big song in the next two or three months. I have links all over for my fans to access my music,” he said.
