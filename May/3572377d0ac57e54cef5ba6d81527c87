We’re blessed, in South Africa, with really lovely weather. And even in Autumn, there are long sunny afternoons where you can sit outside and warm up in the sun. So this weekend, we’re smartening up our outside furniture. A lick of paint and your garden chairs or bench will have a whole new, very pretty, look. The trick to creating a painted finish that lasts is in choosing the right varnish. Chalk Paint Lacquer is not only hard-wearing, but it also has built-in UV protection – so whichever paint colour you choose, you know it will stay vibrant and last longer. Once you’ve followed this tutorial to protecting your paintwork outdoors, you’ll see just how straightforward it is to create a lasting finish. Just remember to make sure every part of your garden furniture is varnished to stop any water getting in – this will ensure complete protection from the elements and prolong the life of the paint.
