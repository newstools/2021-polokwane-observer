Did you know that putting your toddler to bed before the clock strikes 8 pm can prevent obesity? We take a look at the findings of a study published in the Journal of Pediatrics of how earlier bedtimes can benefit the health of your child. Researchers observed 977 children between the ages of four and four and a half. The children who went to bed at 8 pm were less likely to be obese at the age of 15. Researchers found that only 10% of children who went to bed at 8 pm or earlier were obese. 16% of kids whose bedtime was between 8 pm and 9 pm were obese. The most shocking statistic is that 23% of kids who went to bed at 9 pm or later were also obese.
