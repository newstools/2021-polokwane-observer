The deep-voiced local artist’s charismatic rendering of cover songs made for the perfect relaxed atmosphere with a romantic feel after a long week. “My kind of music is ideal for set-ups like Ambiance because it ranges between romantic and nostalgic. It is perfect for such an intimate setting,” he said. The owner of Ambiance, Drienie Venter said that patrons should look out for more surprises from the restaurant because they have exciting plans in future. “The plan is to have a live show once a month but people should just follow us on Facebook to see what we have in store for them, because when we do something, we do it well,” she said.
