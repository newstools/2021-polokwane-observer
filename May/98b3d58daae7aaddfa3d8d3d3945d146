Whether you choose the steak ranch style with generous patties and all the trimmings or a new age smash-burger with gourmet toppings, be sure to top it off with avocado. Chopped, sliced or mashed, avos are the easiest way to add the ultimate touch of luxury to any burger … and not forgetting all that tasty natural goodness. The modern burger is healthier than ever before, shaking off its junk food label by featuring natural and fresh ingredients in its fills and frills.  At the same time, limp lettuce and the obligatory slices of tomato and cheese have made way for much tastier toppings, such as blue, brie and goat’s cheese; chilli and herb salsas; microgreens and sprouts; hummus, tapenade and fruit chutneys; and an array of grilled vegetables. And it goes without saying, fresh creamy avocados are at the top of the list of burger must-haves. So go on, give your burgers a healthy, on-trend edge and add an avo! Serves 4 You’ll need: For the avo meat patties, 500g lean beef mince; 1 egg, lightly beaten; 15ml meat spice; 1 large ripe avocado, mashed; sea salt and freshly ground pepper For the burgers, 4 sesame buns; 2 large ripe avocados, peeled and sliced; 2 ripe tomatoes, sliced; 1 red onion, sliced; 4 cheese slices; fresh rocket or salad leaves; micro herbs to garnish How to: Mix all the patty ingredients lightly with a small fork, do not over mix or the patty will be tough. Leave to rest for 10 minutes. Shape into four patties. Brush the patties lightly on both sides with oil and cook them on a very hot cast iron griddle pan until nicely browned and cooked through. Use a large flat spatula to turn the patties. Slice the buns in half and toast the cut sides. To assemble, place lettuce on the bottom half of each bun, top with the meat patty, cheese slices, add the sliced avocado, a slice of tomato, and add the onion and garnish with micro herbs.
