Tuck into this delicious Thai inspired dish filled with flavour. Serves 2 You’ll need: 15ml fish sauce; 15ml lime or lemon juice; 10ml honey; 20ml oil; half red chilli (chopped); 150g lean rump or sirloin, cut into thin strips; 60ml spring onions, sliced; 80g chopped baby corn; 60g sliced mange tout peas; 40g red pepper, cut into strips; 50g rice noodles, soaked in hot water for 10 minutes and drained; 40ml fresh coriander, chopped; 30g toasted, chopped cashew nuts; 1 egg, lightly beaten; salt and pepper for seasoning; fresh coriander for garnish; lime wedges for garnish. How to: Mix the fish sauce, lime juice and honey – keep aside. Heat a frying pan on high heat and add 10ml oil. Add the chilli and meat and stir fry until the meat is cooked and browned. Remove from the pan and keep aside. Lower the heat and then add the rest of the oil. Add the spring onions, corn, mange tout peas and red pepper. Stir fry for two minutes. Add the rice noodles, meat and the mixture of fish sauce, lime juice and honey. Cook for a minute. In a separate pan, make a very thin pancake with the beaten egg.
