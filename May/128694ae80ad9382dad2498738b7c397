This is made possible by a non-profit organisation, Stepping Stones Foundation, and it offers various programmes for the youth. Kabelo Nkoana, a facilitator of the programme, explained that the aim of the initiative is to educate young people to make better decisions. “We do not want the youth of today to fall into the same cycle as the young people before them. We want to bring change and that change will come as a result of education,” she explained. The foundation focusses on gender-based violence (GBV), something that is currently plaguing the country. She shared that they equip the young women with the skills to deal with GBV in its various forms. “During the sessions, some of the topics speak to the lives of the young women and thus it is important to continue guiding them after the week is over. I have also found that through the programme, lifelong friendships have been formed and we try to sustain them,” she said. At the end of the week, the women will receive certificates to show that they have completed the programme and these certificates can be attached to their documents when applying for work. The foundation also gives the women they work with an opportunity to return back to school should they show commitment towards doing so. Nkoana usually gets people questioned as to why the programme is aimed at women, she explained that in the past, the invitation was extended to young men as well, however, they would not show up for the sessions. “Unlike the women, the men’s attendance was very poor and it made sense to focus on the group with the most attendance,” she said. In an attempt to make the programme accessible, Stepping Stones goes to the communities and ensure that they meet in a safe space. “We go where they feel safe and we have them in a group. We usually make use of churches, community halls and other facilities that are made available to us at the time,” she said. To be part of these sessions contact Kabelo Nkoana on 081 289 6528.
