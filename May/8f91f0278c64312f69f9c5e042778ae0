For many, the art of Macrame is an outlet and provides a creative way to get distracted from day-to-day stress and/ or anxiety. This knotting technique dates to the early 1900s and enhances any visual instantly by providing a fun bohemian finish to any living space. What is more, Macrame is a skill that anyone can learn to create a functional or visually appealing item. Below are some tips and tricks from Builders to help you enhance your living space by creating your Macrame pieces. You’ll need:  Fold a length of T-shirt yarn in half and fold the loop around the dowel. Insert the yarn ends through the loop and pull tight to form a knot. Place cord 1 over cords 2 and 3 (the knot carriers). Place cord 4 over the end of cord 1, under cords 3 and 2 and insert through the loop and over cord 1. Place 1 over 3 and 2. Place 4 over the end of 1. Insert 4 under 1, 2 and 3, through the loop and out over 1. Pull tight to form a knot. Pass the cord from the back to the front over the knot carrier (the cord that was brought in) and again from the front to the back. Bring the end out through the two knots.
