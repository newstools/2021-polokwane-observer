POLOKWANE – The Polokwane Municipality says they are engaging with Lepelle Northern Water (LNW) to find a solution to the current water supply issues in the municipal area. Municipal spokesperson, Thipa Selala says as of Wednesday both the Potgieter and Krugersburg 30Ml Dome and Flat reservoirs have been at 0%. The Krugersburg 50Ml is also low and currently stands on 9% while Seshego is at 10%, he adds. “These levels show no sign of improvement and several supply areas are currently without water supply.” He says the municipality is working with LNW to establish the cause of the low levels. “The municipality has in the meantime deployed water tankers to affected areas to assist with water supply and urges residents to use water sparingly.”
