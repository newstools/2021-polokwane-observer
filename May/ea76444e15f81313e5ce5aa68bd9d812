For some parts of the month he is a loving husband and father to his wife and children in Venda and for the other parts he is the caring father for quadriplegic residents at Centenary House. “I saw an advert for the position of house father and decided to apply. I got the job and I love every minute of it. I go home at least every second weekend to spend time with my family.” At Centenary House there are four different houses, each occupied by residents with different disabilities. Some are mentally disabled while others are physical disabled. In Aaron’s house there are about 17 men who are severely disabled and need assistance. He has a caregiver who assists with looking after the men, bathing and feeding them. “Sometimes the men challenge me and it becomes difficult, but I love my work. They will demand to be assisted first even though I am busy with someone else. I do the work for the love of the people and not for the money. “At times I feel tired, but then I rest on my off weekends. Spending time with my family helps to restore my energy. I also spend time in the open air and visit friends.” Aaron says he loves taking care of others and helping them where needed. He will not pass someone that needs assistance without trying to help. The residents go to the workshop on a daily basis where they are kept busy with activities such as knitting and colouring.
