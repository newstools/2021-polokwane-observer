Molokomme, who matriculated from Capricorn High School in 2018, says it took six rounds of auditions before he got a job at one of the biggest youth edutainment shows in the country. “After my parents convinced me to study at the University of Johannesburg (UJ), I joined an agency and began auditioning. I believe I was selected because I was true to myself and did not pretend to be someone I am not,” he said. Thabiso has been on screen since March 2020 and says it has been a great learning experience. “My co-host, Palesa Mothopi is the absolute best. She is my TV best friend and we work well together. It does not feel like we are working at all,” he added. Thabiso says his favourite show to date was when they hosted the Dube Brothers as he is a fan. “My love for the trio began in Gr 11 when I went through a difficult time. I listened to their music all the time and it helped me through that period,” he explained. Being a host on YoTv is just the beginning for Thabiso as he continues to grow in the industry, and says the bright lights of the entertainment industry have not gotten to his head. “I am just a normal teen with a big personality. I enjoy spending time with my friends and just catching up. Whenever I get the opportunity to come home, my friends are the first to see me after my family,” he said. He often gets long stares of recognition whenever he is out and about. He is passionate about education and is an A-student, which he says is deliberate because he has ambitions of “becoming the youngest Minister of Education”.
