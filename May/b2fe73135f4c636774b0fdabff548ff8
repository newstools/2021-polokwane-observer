Serves 6 You’ll need: Wrap/ Crepe batter – 2 eggs; 2 cups low fat milk; 2/3 cup plain flour; 2 tablespoons oil; 1 tablespoon sweet paprika. Prep: Blend all the ingredients in a food blender. Turn the blender off, stir down the flour and blend again. Refrigerate for an hour before using. Filling ingredients: 3 tablespoons avocado oil; 2 cups raw chicken strips; ½ cup thinly sliced red peppers; ½ cup thinly sliced green peppers; 1 ½ cups chicken stock; 2 tablespoons grated fresh root ginger; 2/3 cup roasted, chopped macadamia nuts; ½ cup finely shredded shallots; 2 tablespoons cornflour; 2 tablespoons soy sauce; 2 large avocados, finely diced; 12 cooked wraps/ crepes; 1 avocado half, sliced for garnish); ½ cup mung bean sprouts; ½ cup black sesame seed sprouts. How to: Heat oil in a frying pan and cook the wraps/ crepes – you should get about 12 from the mixture. Set aside. In another frying pan, heat the oil and add the chicken strips, red and green peppers and toss for about five minutes. Add the chicken stock and ginger and allow to simmer, covered, for 10 minutes. Remove the chicken and peppers and toss with the macadamia nuts and shallots. Dissolve cornflour in soy sauce and stir into the stock mixture and cook, stirring, over medium heat until thick – set aside. To serve, mix diced avocado with chicken fill and place into the centre of each wrap/ crepe. Roll up and fry gently on both sides over medium heat in a small amount of avo oil. Spoon over the sauce and garnish with avocado slices, bean sprouts and seed sprouts. For more avo inspiration, visit the South African Avocado Growers’ Association.
