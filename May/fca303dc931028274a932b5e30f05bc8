Multiple areas will be without power supply for six hours on Wednesday, 9 June. The Polokwane Municipality’s Spokesperson, Thipa Selala, informed residents and businesses of a planned electricity supply interruption, which will be in order to remove the earth wire on a 66 kilovolts (kV) line. “The line will be removed, as it causes power outages in various areas. There is currently another that already supplies these areas and therefore the broken line can be removed,” Selala told Observer. He said power supply shall be restored once the maintenance team has completed the work. “All affected areas are advised to treat electrical wiring as live and to switch off all appliances during the downtime, to avoid injury and damage once power supply is restored,” Selala added. Affected areas: For enquiries, residents can contact the Municipal Helpline on 015 023 5000, Electrical Call Centre on 015 023 5490/5707, or WhatsApp on 083 824 9886.
