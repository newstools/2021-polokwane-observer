We need at least one book this month where mums and daughters love, comfort and support. Hello Danielle Steel. The Affair revolves around a family of successful women (typical DS … it’s all designers and TV stars, a fashion magazine editor and a court judge) … and life’s perfect and glam. Until one is heartbroken and humiliated when news of her husband’s affair is splashed over the pages of the newspaper. Mum and daughters come together to heal … and all five realise family is what matters most in life.  You’ve seen the series on Netflix … Kristin Hannah’s Firefly Lane kicks off in the early 1970s, when an unlikely friendship is formed between two girls, one that lasts through 30 years. They’ve been through a lot, but one act of betrayal may be the hurdle that tears them apart. Read it, then share with your best friend.  She has an easy life but makes a living from pretending otherwise. She has a husband who hates the spotlight, but can’t step away. She has a million followers who adore her, but one who wants her to suffer. She hasn’t yet realised her family is in danger. But she will! Ellery Lloyd’s People Like Her is a smart, thrilling book that delves into the darkest aspects of influencer culture. All from www.exclusivebooks.co.za
