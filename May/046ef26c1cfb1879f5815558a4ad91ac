After working a full week, the last thing busy parents want to do is have a frantic and rushed weekend. Here are a few ways you can keep the kids entertained while you relax today! You don’t have to spend the morning in the gym or go for a 10km run. Just take a walk around the block. Working up a sweat releases endorphins and neurotransmitters that regulate and lift your mood. Arrange regular play dates for your little ones with other families on a Saturday. While the kids are off having fun with their friends, you can relax and enjoy some much-need ‘me’ time. Grab a blanket, book, and a ball to keep the kids busy and head to your nearest park. You can read your book under the trees while the little ones have fun on the grass. Just 5 minutes in a green area can have a positive influence on your state of mind. If the weather’s miserable outside, get out a board game and get the whole family to play with. You can have a fun treat or prize for the winner. Getting your children to settle on the couch in front of a movie the whole family will enjoy gives you some peace and quiet for about an hour. Digging around in the garden can be very therapeutic. Start your own herb or vegetable garden and get the kids to help!
