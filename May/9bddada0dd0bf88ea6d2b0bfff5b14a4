A total of 20 candidates took part from various districts in the province and it is the biggest group in 10 years. “Promoting coaching in Limpopo is a priority, and it will hopefully increase tennis participation in Limpopo,” said the course facilitator, Ghizela Enslin, who is a coaching manager at Tennis South Africa. The course was aimed at assisting the participants to understand how to organise and deliver a tennis session and other tennis activities to beginner level players of all ages. “The course consists of hours and coaches complete a written exam as well as a playing ability test. Coaches now have to go and complete practical hours and one practical assessment in order to complete the certification,” she added. Some of the coaches who took part form part of the TSA BNP Paribas Coaches mentorship programme where coaches are sponsored to attend the course. The programme also aims to create opportunities for black and female coaches across all provinces.
