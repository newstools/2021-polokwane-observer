The initiative, run by the church, serves solid and nutritious meals to anyone who lives on the street or who is hungry. Chantelle Vergueiro, the organiser of the seminar said, “The Mat 19 meals are doing well, there has been a massive response and God is providing.” Mat 19 meals take place on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, serving approximately 90 people per day. The seminar was a fundraiser divided into two sessions. The first session tackled bereavement by Susan van der Merwe, a psychologist and she explained the tasks of bereavement and mourning the loss of someone. “She explained how initially there is disbelieve, you cannot believe the person has died, then there is a stage of anger, a stage of sadness and then regret and guilt and sometimes as stage of relieve that the person is no longer suffering,” said Vergueiro. The second session was dedicated to teens and young adults and how they can relate to each other. “Being a teenager is very difficult especially in today’s society and older people had it different so we do not always know how to relate and bring us together to unite and bring healing,” she concluded.
