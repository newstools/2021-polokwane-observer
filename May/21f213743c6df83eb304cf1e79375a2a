Entertainment galore was on offer for the entire family. From interesting exhibitions, a jumping castle for the children as well as a cash bar, the fun day had it all. The music of DJ Gogga and Kayla Marx had marketgoers in awe, and children even had the opportunity to go for a horseback ride. The day was surely one not to be missed.
