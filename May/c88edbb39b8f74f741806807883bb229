CRC chariman, Conrad Nieuwoudt, says the fun days are not a new concept and the club introduced them to increase the development of the riders in a competitive environment. The recent fun day definitely accommodated the entire family despite the mud and noise. A number of riders brought their families along to cheer them on and created a festive atmosphere. The 60 riders competed in various classes and the top three riders were given trophies for their performance on the track. Conrad promises that the fun days will always be part of the club’s festivities and helps bring the club community together. He says anyone who wants to join the club can contact him at 072 743 2716.
