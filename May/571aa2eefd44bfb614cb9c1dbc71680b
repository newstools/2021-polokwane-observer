We’ve just heard about this brilliant travel treat …  A Weekend of Campfire Stories with Kingsley Holgate. The exuberant, energetic, enthusiastic force of nature Kingsley Holgate – a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, South African explorer, humanitarian, TV personality, author and storyteller, described as “the most travelled man in Africa”, will share his stories with you around the campfire at a Boma dinner at Thanda Safari. This five-star private game reserve, set in the ancient land in the northern reaches of Zululand, KwaZulu Natal where the Great Rift Valley meets the Lebombo Mountains, and home to an amazing variety of wildlife and bird species, provides the perfect backdrop for the larger-than-life stories of one of Africa’s most colourful modern day explorers.  The weekend, from Friday to Sunday June 11 to 13 (coming up fast, so we advise you book soon), will not only include the fireside stories with Kingsley, but also four game drives. Kinsley will be staying at the Thanda Tented Camp, he’ll join guests on game drives, mingle with guests and be there to chat. If you have any of his books, take them along … he’ll be happy to sign them for you. Packages start at R2 995 per person sharing at Tented Camp (R5 990 per person/ R11 980 per couple for a two-night stay) which includes  accommodation in the luxurious, spacious colonial safari-style tents, each with private viewing deck and en-suite bathroom, four game drives with guide and tracker, all meals and selected local beverages (soft drinks, house wines, spirits and beers);  excluded is the conservation levy of R200 per person per stay, gratuities and all items of a personal nature. Booking is essential. Details: reservations@thanda.co.za  or phone 032 586 0149
