According to South Africa Tourism acting Chief Quality Assurance Officer, Amanda Kotze-Nhlapo SA Tourism wants to make sure that the tourists are looked after when it comes to the pandemic that we are in. “We are also here to assist establishments so that they can build trust with the tourists again. I am glad that all the establishments are complying to the Covid-19 regulations. What impressed me most was that the rooms were well-stocked with items like extra blankets and cutlery. There is no need for tourists to go beyond their hosting establishment. Our establishments are ready to receive the tourists ready to take up adventures again. “Tourism is about creating memories, being together, meeting new people and experiencing new things and places in the country. I want the people of South Africa to be part of the team so that we can rebuild our economy and the tourism industry,” said Kotze-Nhlapo. Danlee Overnight Accommodation owner, Amanda Eliss said she was overwhelmed by the visit. “During the pandemic, bookings went down drastically. The company that used to refer their clients and employees for accommodation for about four days a week had to reduce it to two days a week and that affected the business too. We are a three-star overnight accommodation and we hope that business will pick up soon,” said Ellis.
