While it may seem a little strange, obsession with celebrities is a normal part of growing up. As children enter adolescence and begin to form their own identities, they look to media figures for guidance on how to dress and act. That’s why assisting them in finding positive role models is a fantastic idea. In today’s media environment, tweens have access to an almost limitless amount of information. They can watch every movie their heroes have appeared in on Netflix, track down every late-night talk show appearance on YouTube, read their bio on Wikipedia or IMDB, look at candid photos, and read celebrity gossip on celebrity gossip websites. They can also share their enthusiasm with their friends via social media and fan sites. All of this may seem excessive to you, but it’s probably fine unless it interferes with your child’s life.

They may spend all of their money (or ask to borrow yours) to imitate their favourite celebrities. To imitate them, they may engage in potentially dangerous body modifications. Alternatively, they may cause themselves physical harm, such as cutting their skin and posting the results on social media to demonstrate the depth of their feelings.
