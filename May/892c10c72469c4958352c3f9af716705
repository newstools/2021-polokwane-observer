Clubs from all seven clusters in the municipality took part in the tournament which is held four times a year. Matuma Mphelo, chairperson of the association says the tournaments actually start at cluster level where the teams taking part on the day were selected. “From this level there will be other tournaments where the first two teams in the selected age groups will participate with teams from other municipalities.” The girls seemed very excited to be back on the field, saying playing netball is one of the things they had missed the most during the lockdown, and being able to play competitively keeps them going.
